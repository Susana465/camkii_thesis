# Computational models of CaMKII and NMDARs

Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [REFERENCES]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex [REFERENCES], but not on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex therefore making this research novel in its field. The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [Pharris, Ordyan, Bartol] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell. Pharris look at this, Ordyan looks at this, Bartol looks at this. This is what I look at.

There is a plethora of computational models with a focus around CaMKII that use software such as NEURON [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], Smoldyn [@khan2011Sequestration], Cellular Dynamic Simulator [@byrne2011Impacts; @byrne2010Cellular], and more [REFERENCES]. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule [Pharris, CDS paper]. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

Incorporating spatial, temporal, and multimeric aspects is crucial because these dimensions fundamentally shape the behavior of molecular complexes like like the CaMKII/NMDAR interaction. Spatial dynamics can reveal how the molecules interact within different cellular regions, in fact CaMKII phosphorylation levels, as well as its functions have been shown to differ depending on its subcellular localization [@davies2007ACaMKII]. Temporal dynamics are important to understand how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions evolve over time; which is a matter yet to be fully understood, such as: how long does the CaMKII/NMDAR complex last during and/or after LTP?. 

_Needs to go somewhere else not sure where:_ More recently, research is shifting from the long-standing idea that CaMKII behaves like a bistable switch to a new understanding involving a process known as "kinetic proofreading" that enhances the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling. Bartol et al., 2024 propose that for LTP to occur, the autophosphorylation of CaMKII subunits does not need to reach the high, irreversible steady-state associated with the bistable switch theory. Instead, they propose that the integration of signals at the synapse must lead to a temporary surge in autophosphorylation that is sufficient to initiate one or more downstream processes, which are essentially irreversible, ultimately resulting in synaptic potentiation. This proposed mechanism aligns well with the hypothesis that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex at the PSD plays a critical role in stabilizing CaMKII in its autophosphorylated state, thereby facilitating synaptic potentiation. 

## Model description
I use Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with the new MCell4 which combines the spatial simulation features of MCell3 (Kerr et al., 2008) and the rule-based, network-free simulation (NFSim) framework of BioNetGen Language (BNGL) (Faeder et al., 2009). This integration of capabilities offers a flexible and robust tool that is well-suited for investigating the kinetics of complex reactions within the space of a dendritic spine. I model the interactions of various molecules released inside the cell, including Ca²⁺, CaM, CaMKII, PP1, and NMDARs on the cell surface. I examine the binding dynamics of calcium to calmodulin and its subsequent interactions with CaMKII, focusing on the different states of CaMKII (open/closed, active/inactive) and the phosphorylation processes involved. The results emphasize the importance of CaM binding to both CaMKII and NMDARs, as well as the regulatory role of phosphorylation. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the phosphorylated state of CaMKII within the postsynaptic density.

The model was validated against biological results at various stages. First, the calcium release and subsequent binding to CaM were validated against [REFERENCES], testing the sequential binding of calcium. Next, to test for CaMKII activation, I assessed how much CaMKII flickered between active/open and inactive/closed states. Stefan et al. determined that the activation probability (in the absence of CaM and phosphorylation) is 0.002, so I set it to that. This flickering behavior should allow for CaM_Ca4 to bind to the open state, further stabilizing CaMKII, as observed in in vitro and in vivo studies [REFERENCES]. The stabilization of CaMKII in the open state by CaM binding is known as CaM trapping, and our model exhibits this behavior [FIGURE]. Additionally, CaMKII autophosphorylation at T286 and T306 is also modeled to showcase the regulatory functions of these sites.

The model uses a stochastic agent-based approach, where the program tracks only the reactions that occur between existing discrete molecules during the simulation (network-free simulation [119, 120]). A key aspect of this approach is that the number of different states present can be much smaller than the total number of possible states. Generally, stochastic simulations are preferred when the number of particles of a chemical species is small. When the assumption of continuous concentration fails due to limited populations of reactants in a small cellular environment, the ODE representation fails and stochastic simulations are particularly useful.

## Molecule concentrations and cell volume
All molecules were released from inside the cell to interact with each other. Due to the stochastic nature of MCell simulations, molecules are released as discrete units or molecule numbers. Concentrations can be calculated as shown below in @eq-molec-concentrations-calc.  The example calculation below considers an initial release of 10000 molecules and a dendritic volume of 0.5 µm³. The molecule concentrations in this model fall within ranges previously reported in the literature. Specifically, 10000 molecules of Ca²⁺ were released initially, corresponding to an initial [Ca²⁺] of 33.2 µM (Figure 5). Prior studies employing fluorescent Ca²⁺ indicators have shown resting intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca²⁺]i) within 50-100 nM, with increases up to 100-fold under stimulated conditions (Grienberger et al., 2012; Maravall et al., 2000). Reported intracellular [CaM] concentrations, ranging from 8 to 250 µM, align with the values observed here (initial concentration: 6.64 µM) (Black et al., 2004; Kakiuchi et al., 1982).

In the model presented here, reactions of cytoplasmatic molecules specified in BNGL, were placed into the geometry of a postysnaptic dendritic spine with a volume of aproximately 0.5μm3, which is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris et al., 1989). The model contains four protein species: CaM, PP1, CaMKII and NMDARS (see table of molecules included in the model). Initial molecules released inside the cell are: Ca2+ ions, CaM, CaMKII and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Since four calcium ions are needed to fully saturate CaM (CaM_Ca4) [REFERENCES], five times more calcium than CaM and CaMKII was released to ensure it would not be a limiting factor [TABLE REFERENCE]. Interactions between different molecules are modelled as rules in BNGL (as explained in CHAPTER REFERENCE), where each molecule reacts according to certain conditions and kinetic rates.  

- CAMKII model for binding NMDARs
- CaM trapping 
- Dephosphorylation of CaMMKII
- Effects of dephospho when camkii/nmdar binding is taken into acount
- NMDA/CAMKII complex how long does it last? does it change if mutations happen at t286 or t306? 

## Reaction rules and kinetic rates
In BNGL, reaction rules are specified as discrete transformations. For example, the rule “CaM(ca~0,camkii) + Ca() <-> CaM(ca~1,camkii)” represents the binding of a single calcium ion to Calmodulin that is not bound to CaMKII (see reaction #1 in @fig-rxns-table1). The assigned rate constants for each rule are used to calculate the probability of the reaction occurring when the two involved molecules collide, or at a specific time step for unimolecular transformations. 

As molecules diffuse within the simulation volume, all molecules within a specified radius along a given trajectory or at the point of collision on a surface are considered for potential reactions. when a calcium ion molecule encounters a free CaM molecule at the point of collision, they react according to the specified rule in the model, resulting in the formation of the molecule CaM_Ca1. CaM_Ca1  can then continue to diffuse based on the parameters defined in the simulation and can interact with other molecules as well. During runtime, a random seed number generator is initialized with a seed number for each simulation. This generator selects a sequence of random numbers that determines the probabilities of transformations throughout the simulation.

# Modelling CaMKII structure and functions
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II or CaMKII) is a serine/threonine-specific kinase, which means it’s a protein kinase enzyme that phosphorylates the OH group of amino acid residues serine or threonine. CaMKII accounts for up to 2 percent of all brain protein and is essential for memory formation [@erondu1985RegionalDistributionType; @lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction]. CaMKII is involved in many signalling cascades and is thought to be an important mediator of learning and memory. Depending on its component isoforms, CaMKII can also be found in cardiomyocytes for  Ca2+ homeostasis and reuptake [@swaminathan2012CalmodulinDependentProteinKinase], chloride transport in epithelia [@fahrmann2006FunctionalPartitioningEpithelial], positive T-cell selection [@mcgargill2005ActiveCa2Calmodulindependent], and cytotoxic T-cell activation. In this research we focus on CaMKIIα isoform present in postsynaptic neurons which is relevant for memory formation. CaMKII functions are regulated through phosphorylation at multiple sites, and its localization within cells is directed by interactions with specific binding proteins.

The CaMKII holoenzyme is made up of twelve subunits [@bennett1983PurificationCharacterizationCalmodulindependent; @stratton2014ActivationtriggeredSubunitExchange; @bhattacharyya2016MolecularMechanismActivationtriggered; @rosenberg2005StructureAutoinhibitedKinase] arranged as two coplanar rings of six. Each CaMKII subunit features an N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal hub domain [@chao2011MechanismTunableAutoinhibition]. Each subunit has a hub domain, a kinase domain and a flexible regulatory domain which lends to the subunit a wide range of movement away from the holoenzyme’s central hub (@fig-camkii-subunit). @chao2011MechanismTunableAutoinhibition revealed the crystal structure of human alpha-CaMKII from E. coli, demonstrating its ability to transition between "docked" and "undocked" conformations. Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells suggests that less than 3 percent of subunits adopt a compact conformation [@myers2017CaMKII].

In order to model CaMKII molecules as a dodecamer we use BNGL, which allows us to not only model molecules to be multimeric, but also for each subunit to have the following possible states:

- A calmodulin binding site, calmodulin can be bound or unbound
- A NMDAR binding site, CaMKII can be bound or unbound to NMDARs
- A T286 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated or phosphorylated,
- A T306 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated or phosphorylated,
- A status of being open (active) or closed (inactive) -> consider wording of active/inactive.

## Clarifying CaMKII "Activity"

In this model, CaMKII activity is simplified by defining subunit states based solely on whether they are open or closed, while assuming that all subunits are in an undocked state. Although research acknowledges docked and undocked conformations, we exclude them from our model to streamline the focus on the fundamental functional states of CaMKII.

In the closed state, CaMKII subunits are inactive due to the regulatory domain binding to the catalytic site, which prevents activity. In contrast, open subunits possess catalytic activity, as their kinase domains are structurally accessible and not inhibited.

Our model includes autonomous activation in CaMKII subunits, allowing them to flicker between open and closed states when unbound to CaM and unphosphorylated at T286. The binding of CaM or phosphorylation at T286 stabilises the open state by preventing reversion to a closed conformation. Additionally, CaM binding can only occur if the subunit is in an open state due to the structural requirements for high-affinity binding.

Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells (Myers et al., 2017) suggests that fewer than 3% of CaMKII subunits adopt a compact, docked-like conformation (Figure 6). This supports the model's assumption that undocked conformations predominate.

The term “activity” in CaMKII literature can refer to different functional states, such as the enzyme’s ability to phosphorylate substrates, autonomous activity post-CaM dissociation (often via T286 autophosphorylation), or structural openness. Here, we simplify CaMKII activity to the open and closed states, where “activity” specifically refers to the structural availability of the kinase domain for phosphorylation functions.

use here: Notably, multiple studies suggest that the majority of the kinase is found in its activation-competent, extended/undocked conformation ( over 95%), both in vitro and in intact cells (Myers et al., 2017; Sloutsky et al., 2020) https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8985225/. Additionally, at its basal state, CaMKII is found with its subunits mostly in their closed, inactive state where the regulatory domain is bound to the kinase domain [FIGURE].

## Binding of calcium to calmodulin
CaM is modelled as being able to bind four calcium ions; CaM has four EF hands divided into N and C lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe. The N lobe binds calcium faster with lower affinity and the C lobe binds slower with higher affinity [REFERENCES]. Numerous models have been developed to investigate the dynamics of calcium binding to CaM [REFERENCES]. Linkevicius et al. (2024) examined and compared various of these models, providing a useful summary of the typical categories for modeling CaM binding to Ca2+. The model used here falls under their proposed "scheme 3" (@fig-scheme3-cam), where calcium binds and unbinds to four separate calcium binding sites in calmodulin. Unlike other models that distinguish between CaM's N-terminal and C-terminal binding lobes, this project does not, as the specifics of calcium binding to calmodulin are beyond its scope. Additionally, following "scheme 3" approach to calcium binding produces biologically relevant results while avoiding complexity, allowing us to focus on further CaMKII and NMDARs interactions.

![We model calcium binding to calmodulin following "scheme 3" proposed by Linkevicius et al., 2024. It is a sequential calmodulin scheme where each binding site is represented individually. Figure modified from Linkevicius et al., 2024.](30-methods-figures\scheme3_cam.PNG){#fig-scheme3-cam} 

## Binding of calmodulin to CaMKII
Calmodulin bound to different amounts of calcium has been shown to bind to CaMKII with different affinities, with calmodulin bound to four calcium having the highest affinity [REFERENCE]. In this model, for simplicity, we therefore assume that only fully saturated CaM with four calciums binds to open CaMKII subunits. Additionally, CaM binds to a CaMKII subunit only if T306 is dephosphorylated. The T305/T306 site lies within the CaM binding region. It has been shown that autophosphorylation at T305/T306 impedes CaM binding, and similarly CaM binding prevents T306 phosphorylation [26] [@rellos2010Structure]. In the model here, CaM is able to bind to CaMKII with the following rules:

- CaM must be fully saturated (bound to four calcium ions), i.e. only CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII. We assume only one high affinity binding site for CaM in each CaMKII subunit.
- CaMKII subunit must be in its open/active state.
- T306 must be unphosphorylated.

It has been suggested that there are both low- and high-affinity binding sites for calmodulin within the regulatory domain of a CaMKII subunit [REFERENCES]. While CaM binding to the low-affinity site is compatible with CaMKII remaining in a closed state, binding to the high-affinity site is thought to structurally prevent CaMKII from closing (Stefan et al., 2012, MORE REFERENCES). If CaM initially binds to the low-affinity site while the kinase is inactive/closed, it might "slide" along residues 291-312 to the higher-affinity site, thereby shifting the CaMKII subunit into its open/active state (need REFERENCE?). Once bound to this high-affinity site, CaM prevents the subunit from returning to its closed state, maintaining its active conformation.

Stefan et al., 2012 predicted that calmodulin binding in itself was not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of calmodulin is. Likely due to the stabilising effect of high affinity binding of CaM to CaMKII structurally keeping the kinase in its active state. Additionally, T286 phosphorylation has been shown to also stabilise CaMKII in an active state, therefore making the high-affinity binding site accessible [REFERENCE]. 

In fact, stochastic simulations of a biochemical model showed that two such binding sites, with only one of them accessible in the active, open conformation, could be sufficient to explain calmodulin trapping by CaMKII [reference from stefan et al., 2012]. In the model used in this PhD project, I propose that CaM can remain bound and in a "trapped" position without modelling the low affinity binding site. CaM-trapping happens as CaM binding affinity increases with CaMKII subunit phosphorylation at T286 (REFERENCE), and CaM therefore remains bound to CaMKII subunits for longer. In a dynamic interplay, as autophosphorylation promoted CaM trapping, CaM trapping has also been proposed to lead to an enhanced, non-linear increase in autophosphorylation of CaMKII during high-frequency synaptic stimulations (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998; Nicoll and Schulman, 2023; Putney, 1998).

The literature often describes CaM binding as activating CaMKII. However, this may not always be the case. When a CaMKII subunit spontaneously flickers into its active/open state CaM binding is likely to stabilize the subunit once it is already active, but not to initiate activation. Similarly, while it is commonly suggested that simultaneous binding of CaM to two neighboring subunits triggers T286 autophosphorylation, we propose that CaM's role might be more nuanced. Instead of being essential for T286 phosphorylation, CaM may stabilize the open state of CaMKII, thereby increasing the likelihood of phosphorylation. Therefore, in this model, we do not make it a requirement for CaM to be bound to neighbouring subunits for phosphorylation to happen. We consider CaM binding is not strictly necessary for autophosphorylation but rather enhances the probability of phosphorylation by maintaining subunits in their active/open state.

## CaMKII phosphorylation and dephosphorylation

The most extensively studied phosphorylation sites on CaMKII are Thr286 and Thr305/Thr306 as they have been shown to be key for CaMKII activity regulation and subcellular localization at the PSD during LTP, which is of relevance for synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory. Likewise, in this study, we focus on these two sites. While other phosphorylation sites on CaMKII have been identified, their functions are not yet fully understood and are not within the scope of this study. 

### T286 phosphorylation
Phosphorylation of T286 can happen if two adjascent CaMKII subunits are in their open states, through a process known as autophosphorylation. CaMKII subunits need to be open to expose the ATP binding site, allowing the gamma-phosphate of ATP to transfer to the threonine residue at T286. The open (kinase domain available) and undocked (subunits can reach their neighbours) states of two neighbouring subunits is crucial for the catalytic site of one subunit to reach and phosphorylate its neighboring subunit. In our model, we assume ATP molecule levels are sufficient to ensure the reaction proceeds at its maximal rate (saturating), so we do not model ATP as a reactant but rather focus on the phosphorylation process under these conditions.

Calmodulin bound to two neighbouring subunits is often referred to in the literature as being required for autophosphorylation (REFERENCES). As calmodulin has been shown to keep CaMKII subunits in their open state, and therefore it may indirectly enhance probability of T286 phosphorylation. In the model I use here I don't make calmodulin a requirement for T286 phosphorylation, but rather once CaMKII is bound to CaM_Ca4, this binding keeps CaMKII subunits in their open state and further enables phosphorylation.

Autophosphorylation at threonine 286 (T286) and calmodulin (CaM) binding engage in a dynamic, reciprocal interaction, where each event amplifies the other, leading to a finely tuned regulation of CaMKII activity. Phosphorylation at T286 exposes key residues, phenylalanine (F) and glutamine (N), within the CaM-binding domain, which significantly enhances CaM's binding affinity, reportedly increasing it by 10- to 1000-fold [REFERENCES]. This enhanced binding phenomenon, termed CaM-trapping, is thought to facilitate further autophosphorylation of CaMKII. Notably, autophosphorylation allows for sustained kinase activity even after CaM dissociates from CaMKII [REFERENCES].

### T305/T306 phosphorylation
In contrast to T286 phosphorylation, T305/T306 (T306 hereforth) phosphorylation prevents binding of CaM, as the phosphate group added to the threonine creates electrostatic and steric interference, occupying the position where CaM normally interacts. In the model used here, CaM can therefore only bind to CaMKII if the T306 site is not phosphorylated, and conversely, phosphorylation at T306 cannot occur while CaM is bound. Similar to the conditions for T286, the model requires that a subunit must be in the open state for phosphorylation at T306 to take place. Since T286 phosphorylation maintains subunits in their open state, transphosphorylation at T306 is more likely to occur if a neighboring subunit is phosphorylated at T286.

An aspect of phosphorylation at this site is that it does not prevent CaMKII subunits from closing, unlike T286 phosphorylation. This, together with the fact that it prevents CaM from binding, makes it more likely that subunits that are phosphorylated at T306 are found in the closed state too. When the subunit is closed, catalytic activity of the kinase is reduced, as the kinase domain is not accessible to perform catalytic activity. Therefore, this phosphorylation is ofen refered to as reducing catalytic activity of CaMKII. T306 phosphorylation may act as a form of kinetic proofreading, by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive, or less active, unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. It prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling in response to synaptic activity.

### Dephosphorylation of CaMKII subunits

There are multiple known phosphatases which act to dephosphorylate CaMKII. Different dephosphatase proteins will carry their function depending on their localization and what protein assemblies they are bound to or are available for them. Importantly, the Ser/Thr phosphatase Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a key regulator of CaMKII signaling [REFERENCES]; it can dephosphorylate both T286 and T306 sites of the kinase. 

The colocalization with PSD-associated PP1 or sequestration away from PP2A may be attributable to CaMKII interactions with specific PSD proteins, resulting in differential modulation of Thr286 dephosphorylation. PP1 can form a complex with over 50 regulatory or scaffolding proteins that dictate substrate specificity and subcellular localization. PP1 is a heterodimer comprised of a catalytic subunit that is constitutively active and a regulatory subunit. There are four known PP1 subunit isoforms of the catalytic subunit (α, β, γ1, and γ2), each interacting with over 40 known regulatory and/or target subunits. PP1α has been shown to account for the majority of phosphatase actvity with CaMKII in the PSD [REFERENCE]. Therefore, we focus on PP1α in this study. 

In the model used here, PP1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of CaMKII without forming a stable enzyme-substrate complex. Instead, the reaction proceeds in a manner where PP1 transiently interacts, without binding, with a CaMKII subunit under specific conditions, facilitating the dephosphorylation process. PP1 can only dephosphorylate CaMKII subunits when they are unbound from calmodulin (CaM), as CaM structurally obstructs access to the T286 phosphorylation site. Additionally, the CaMKII subunit must be in its open conformation to expose both the T286 and T306 sites for PP1-mediated dephosphorylation (see @fig-camkii-binding-rxns).

![CaMKII subunit possibility of binding reactions. ](30-methods-figures\camkii-binding-rxns.PNG){#fig-camkii-binding-rxns}

for dephospho of camkii bound to nmndar: Binding of CaMKII to GluN2B suggests potential phosphorylation of the receptor by the kinase. Indeed, the binding between the catalytic domain of CaMKII and GluN2B 1290–1309 represents an enzyme-substrate mode of interactions and results in phosphorylation of S1303 within the binding region [16]. The Km of S1303 phosphorylation was in a nanomolar range, much lower than that of other known substrates of CaMKII, indicating that the receptor is a high affinity substrate. As expected, phospho-S1303 (pS1303) is also subject to the dephosphorylation modulation by phosphatases. Both protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylated pS1303 in the GluN2B CT [17]. In the PSD, PP1 is a major phosphatase catalyzing S1303 dephosphorylation [18]._

# Modelling NMDARs structure and functions

The NMDAR is an ionotropic glutamate receptor. Ionotropic channel proteins open to allow ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and/or Cl- to pass through the membrane in response to the binding of a chemical messenger. NMDARs are permeable to Ca2+, Na+ and K+ ions and have a voltage dependent Mg2+ block. NMDARs, depending on the subunit composition, have glutamate and glycine as its ligands, the former being more common and the latter acting as a co-agonist. The binding of a ligand to NMDARs is typically not sufficient to open the channel and let ions through, as this is usually blocked by Mg2+ ions  (voltage block) which are only removed once the neuron is sufficiently depolarized. 

[INSERT NMDAR FIGURE]

NMDARs are heterotetramers commonly composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. They can also be found in other conformations having GluN3 subunits. There are different subunit subtypes, for example GluN2 can be found as GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C or GluN2D, and we know there are GluN3A and 3B isoforms too  [@ciabarra1995CloningCharacterizationChi1; @kvist2013StructurebasedDiscoveryAntagonists]. All subunits exhibit a similar membrane structure, consisting of three transmembrane domains (M1, M3, and M4), a hydrophobic hairpin domain (M2), an extracellular N-terminus, and an intracellular C-terminus (CT). The CT regions of GluN2A and GluN2B are notably larger, and together with the relatively shorter CT of GluN1, they form critical areas that contain well-defined sites for protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation.

Depending on which subunits NMDARs exhibit, they will have slightly different properties and therefore different functions. There is even something called a “GluN2B-GluN2A developmental switch”, where GluN2B is predominantly present in the early postnatal brain, but switches to GluN2A during early development; eventually, GluN2A subunits become more numerous than GluN2B. These subtypes have different kinetics, and higher amounts of GluN2B subunit leads to NMDA receptors which remain open longer compared to those with more GluN2A [@liu2004SwitchingNMDAReceptor]. This may, in part, account for greater memory abilities in the immediate postnatal period compared to late in life [@bar-shira2015GeneExpressionSwitching]. These findings were obtained from rats, killed in order to look at certain sections of their brains, just as many of the other experiments mentioned in this project. 

NMDARs can be expressed in neuroglia, non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system with a main objective of maintaining homeostasis and myelin formation [@fields2014GlialBiologyLearning]. However, its expression is mainly located to dendritic spines where, through subunit-specific interactions, it connects to intracellular molecules of the postsynaptic multi-protein network, or postsynaptic density area, known as the PSD. One of the proteins that interacts with NMDARs in the PSD is CaMKII, among many others which are not included in the description of this project but can be found extensively throughout publications [@volianskis2015LongtermPotentiationRole].

# Modelling CaMKII binding to NMDARs

First lay out the biology, then lay out the hypotheses.

So we know x, y, and z, we expect to see blablabla. 

When it comes to CaMKII and NMDAR binding, we have to think about where the molecules bind in the CaMKII molecule, and where they bind on the NMDARs. Additionally, it will be important to think about where they bind structutrally as this will affect the access of other molecules and substrates have to these molecules once they are bound. 

Direct binding of CaMKII to GluN2A/B is noteworthy. In hippocampal and cortical neurons, CaMKII colocalized with NMDARs in confined subcellular compartments and CaMKII-NMDAR complexes were readily coimmunoprecipitated, while CaMKII did not coprecipitated with AMPARs [10–12]. In binding assays with purified recombinant proteins and/or peptides, CaMKII was found to directly bind to the GluN2A/B CT with high affinity [11–14]. It is now known that CaMKII binds to the membrane proximal residues 839–1120 and residues 1290–1310 in the GluN2B CT.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4435801/

Transient activity elicits Ca2+/CaM-dependent binding of GluN2B to a substrate-binding site (S-site) within the catalytic domain of CaMKII, whereas prolonged activity leads to persistent GluN2B binding to a T286-binding site (T-site) adjacent to the S-site [13–15]. The GluN2B binding to the T-site blocks the binding of the T-site to the regulatory region of CaMKII, thereby prolonging CaMKII activity after Ca2+ signals subside. Thus, activation of CaMKII by stimulating Ca2+-permeable NMDARs in forebrain neurons increased the CaMKII association with NMDARs [12,15]. This suggests a dynamic mechanism for the activity-dependent recruitment of CaMKII to the PSD to regulate a discrete set of local substrates.

Enzymatic Activity of CaMKII Is Not Required for Its Interaction with the Glutamate Receptor Subunit GluN2B - https://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/84/6/834.short?casa_token=WnVw1zJg1dQAAAAA:HOrY5_Xt0hJf2SRLL5uatSaBoSDEGHpHn1iOcUhb-_cIbagC6DQJBxTdYCmuPbuEC7RKCUSDan-zYA 

When CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation that results in constitutive, Ca2+-independent activity exposure of a binding site for the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B. -> is it like this though? or again is it a case of events description, is just open state? and more likely if P?

either way, it binds to glun2b of nmdar. The activated state (autophosphorylated or not) can bind the COOH-terminal tail of GluN2B on a surface groove and T site previously occupied by the regulatory segment . Lys1292–Arg1303 (within the GluN2B subunit). The Ser1303 residue on GluN2B is also important, as it is a known phosphorylation site, further modulating the interaction.

there is recent evidence that T286 phosphorylation is required for maintaining the stability of the CaMKII-GluN2B complex.

The binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR requires an activated open form of the kinase. Therefore, the recent optical experiments [15] demonstrating that CaMKII is only transiently activated after LTP induction (~1 minute) could suggest that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex is also transient. https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-6-10#:~:text=The%20binding%20of%20CaMKII%20to,NMDAR%20complex%20is%20also%20transient. (this looks like a good paper)

CaMKII phosphorylates a serine residue (S1303) in the GluN2B CT. CaMKII also phosphorylates a serine site (S831) in the CT of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors. 

what do these P actions do? need to find out. 

CaMKII directly binds both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits via binding sites located in
the CTDs of the receptor subunits (Bayer et al., 2001, 2006; Gardoni et al., 1999; Leonard et al., 1999; Strack et al., 2000); however, it has a greater affinity for GluN2B (Strack and Colbran, 1998). 

Two CaMKII-binding sites have been identified in the GluN2B subunit at residues 839–1120 and 1290–1310 (Strack and Colbran, 1998; Leonard et al., 1999; Strack et al., 2000; Bayer et al., 2001) @kellermayer2018Superresolution 

In fact, this NR2B domain contains two sites with different modes of regulated CaMKII binding (Fig. 1), a Ca2+/CaM-regulated site within residues 1120–1482 of NR2B (NR2B-C) and a phosphorylation-regulated site within residues 839–1120 (NR2B-P). https://www.nature.com/articles/35081080

Transient CaMKII activity evokes an initial reversible, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent binding of GluN2B to the substrate-binding site within the catalytic domain of CaMKII, whereas prolonged
enzymatic activity leads to a persistent interaction between GluN2B and the Thr286-binding
site of CaMKII, locking CaMKII in an active conformation, as mentioned above

The site-specific phosphorylation is either constitutively active or activity-dependently regulated by changing synaptic or intracellular inputs. Through the phosphorylation mechanism, CaMKII regulates expression of iGluRs and mGluRs at postsynaptic sites and controls glutamatergic synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4435801/ 

what we know more surely:
When a CaMKII subunit is bound to the C-terminal tail of GluN2B, the binding protects CaMKII from reclosure, maintaining the constitutive activity CaMKII on other substrates42.

# Hypotheses/expected outcomes when running the model

With what I know from papers, and with how the model is set up, these are outcomes I expect the model to produce:

## CaMKII is found mostly in its open state (even prior to cam binding, so that cam can actually bind to it),  but then ->

## CaM binding stabilises CaMKII in higher quantity and for longer. And viceversa, if no cam, camkii eventually found open at lower levels. 

## The spatial arrangement and clustering of NMDARs influences the likelihood and duration of CaMKII-NMDAR binding.

**Rationale:** NMDARs are not uniformly distributed but often form clusters at the postsynaptic membrane. CaMKII's ability to bind to NMDARs might be influenced by how these receptors are spatially organized within the synapse. Understanding how receptor clustering affects CaMKII’s capacity to bind and phosphorylate NMDARs could reveal critical insights into synaptic plasticity mechanisms.

**Predicted Outcomes**
- In a clustered arrangement, CaMKII is more likely to engage multiple NMDARs simultaneously, which could lead to more stable and prolonged binding events, potentially amplifying synaptic signaling.
- In a dispersed arrangement, CaMKII binding may become more transient, limiting its ability to phosphorylate multiple NMDARs.

## The autophosphorylation state of CaMKII regulates its binding duration to NMDARs and subsequent phosphorylation dynamics.

**Rationale:** CaMKII’s ability to remain active after calcium/calmodulin binding is influenced by its autophosphorylation at Thr286, which can make CaMKII "autonomous." This autonomous state allows CaMKII to remain active and bound to NMDARs even when calcium levels drop.

**Predicted Outcomes**

Autophosphorylated CaMKII should exhibit longer binding durations to NMDARs, maintaining synaptic potentiation even after calcium levels drop.
The non-autophosphorylated CaMKII may dissociate more quickly, resulting in shorter windows for NMDAR phosphorylation and less effective synaptic potentiation.

## When CaMKII is T306p:
- CaMKII is found bound to NMDARs in lesser amounts in comparison to when T286p
- To do this I can:
1. Track how the binding affinity between CaMKII and the NMDAR (particularly GluN2B) changes in the T306p state compared to the unphosphorylated state.
2. Investigate whether the duration and stability of CaMKII-NMDAR binding are reduced when T306 is phosphorylated, resulting in fewer interactions with NMDARs over time.

- CaMKII retains partial activity, but not as high as when T286p (expected between 20 and 40% of maximal activity)
- To do this I can:
1. Record the amount of CaMKII that is t306p only -> how much of it is closed and how much is it open/active.

- extra: Incorporate calcium dynamics: model how calcium transients affect CaMKII activation in both T306p and non-T306p states, comparing the kinase’s ability to maintain activity during and after calcium influx.

**Rationale:** T306 phosphorylation blocks CaM binding, reducing CaMKII’s sensitivity to calcium transients. As a result, T306-phosphorylated CaMKII may have reduced binding affinity for NMDARs compared to its unphosphorylated form. However, CaMKII may still retain some activity through other subunits within the dodecamer, or by autophosphorylation at Thr286, allowing for partial phosphorylation of NMDARs. This could lead to weaker but non-null phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit (potentially supporting transient synaptic plasticity rather than sustained potentiation.). 

Specifically, does T286 need to be phosphorylated to maintain the stability of the CaMKII-GluN2B complex (see sect. 9.2.1)?  https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00034.2022

A prediction of the basic properties of CaMKII described above is that with brief repetitive Ca2+ spikes the enzyme would recruit more Ca2+/CaM, increasing the probability of autophosphorylation and a higher level of activity (FIGURE 3).https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00034.2022

 It is assumed that with the near-saturating pairing protocol used to induce LTP the majority of the subunits of a holoenzyme would be phosphorylated (see last Ca2+ pulse in FIGURE 3B2).https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00034.2022
