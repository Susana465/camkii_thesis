  abstract = {Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) at synapses in the CNS triggers changes in synaptic strength that underlie memory formation in response to strong synaptic stimuli. The primary target of Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) which forms dodecameric holoenzymes that are highly concentrated at the postsynaptic site. Activation of CaMKII is necessary to trigger long-term potentiation of synaptic strength (LTP), and is prolonged by autophosphorylation of subunits within the holoenzyme. Here we use MCell4, an agent-based, stochastic, modeling platform to model CaMKII holoenzymes placed within a realistic spine geometry. We show how two mechanisms of regulation of CaMKII, ‘Ca2+-calmodulin-trapping (CaM-trapping)’ and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) shape the autophosphorylation response during a repeated high-frequency stimulus. Our simulation results suggest that autophosphorylation of CaMKII does not constitute a bistable switch. Instead, prolonged but temporary, autophosphorylation of CaMKII may contribute to a biochemical-network-based ‘kinetic proof-reading” mechanism that controls induction of synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Serial electron microscopy and 3-D reconstructions of dendritic spines from hippocampal area CA 1 dendrites were obtained to evaluate 2 questions about relationships between spine geometry and synaptic efficacy. First, under what biophysical conditions are the spine necks likely to reduce the magnitude of charge transferred from the synapses on the spine heads to the recipient dendrite? Simulation software provided by Charles Wilson (1984) was used to determine that if synaptic conductance is 1 nS or less, only 1\% of the hippocampal spine necks are sufficiently thin and long to reduce charge transfer by more than 10\%. If synaptic conductance approaches 5 nS, however, 33\% of the hippocampal spine necks are sufficiently thin and long to reduce charge transfer by more than 10\%. Second, is spine geometry associated with other anatomical indicators of synaptic efficacy, including the area of the postsynaptic density and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axon? Reconstructed spines were graphically edited into head and neck compartments, and their dimensions were measured, the areas of the postsynaptic densities (PSD) were measured, and all of the vesicles in the presynaptic axonal varicosities were counted. The dimensions of the spine head were well correlated with the area of PSD and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axonal varicosity. Spine neck diameter and length were not correlated with PSD area, head volume, or the number of vesicles. These results suggest that the dimensions of the spine head, but not the spine neck, reflect differences in synaptic efficacy. We suggest that the constricted necks of hippocampal dendritic spines might reduce diffusion of activated molecules to neighboring synapses, thereby attributing specificity to activated or potentiated synapses.},

  abstract = {Learning and the underlying long-lasting increases in glutamatergic synapse strength [called long-term potentiation (LTP)] require both Ca2+ influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and the kinase CaMKII. New evidence now suggests that CaMKII can induce LTP purely by binding to the NMDAR subunit GluN2B and does not require the catalytic activity of the kinase.}

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are small, bulbous compartments that function as postsynaptic sites and undergo intense biochemical and biophysical activity. The role of the myriad signaling pathways that are implicated in synaptic plasticity is well studied. A recent abundance of quantitative experimental data has made the events associated with synaptic plasticity amenable to quantitative biophysical modeling. Spines are also fascinating biophysical computational units because spine geometry, signal transduction, and mechanics work in a complex feedback loop to tune synaptic plasticity. In this sense, ideas from modeling cell motility can inspire us to develop multiscale approaches for predictive modeling of synaptic plasticity. In this article, we review the key steps in postsynaptic plasticity with a specific focus on the impact of spine geometry on signaling, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and membrane mechanics. We summarize the main experimental observations and highlight how theory and computation can aid our understanding of these complex processes. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biophysics, Volume 53 is May 2024.

  abstract = {Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has long been known to play an important role in learning and memory as well as long term potentiation (LTP). More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of Ca2+ signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over Ca2+ signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed in vivo. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.
