  abstract = {Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has long been known to play an important role in learning and memory as well as long term potentiation (LTP). More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of Ca2+ signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over Ca2+ signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed in vivo. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.

  abstract = {Serial electron microscopy and 3-D reconstructions of dendritic spines from hippocampal area CA 1 dendrites were obtained to evaluate 2 questions about relationships between spine geometry and synaptic efficacy. First, under what biophysical conditions are the spine necks likely to reduce the magnitude of charge transferred from the synapses on the spine heads to the recipient dendrite? Simulation software provided by Charles Wilson (1984) was used to determine that if synaptic conductance is 1 nS or less, only 1\% of the hippocampal spine necks are sufficiently thin and long to reduce charge transfer by more than 10\%. If synaptic conductance approaches 5 nS, however, 33\% of the hippocampal spine necks are sufficiently thin and long to reduce charge transfer by more than 10\%. Second, is spine geometry associated with other anatomical indicators of synaptic efficacy, including the area of the postsynaptic density and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axon? Reconstructed spines were graphically edited into head and neck compartments, and their dimensions were measured, the areas of the postsynaptic densities (PSD) were measured, and all of the vesicles in the presynaptic axonal varicosities were counted. The dimensions of the spine head were well correlated with the area of PSD and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axonal varicosity. Spine neck diameter and length were not correlated with PSD area, head volume, or the number of vesicles. These results suggest that the dimensions of the spine head, but not the spine neck, reflect differences in synaptic efficacy. We suggest that the constricted necks of hippocampal dendritic spines might reduce diffusion of activated molecules to neighboring synapses, thereby attributing specificity to activated or potentiated synapses.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are small, bulbous compartments that function as postsynaptic sites and undergo intense biochemical and biophysical activity. The role of the myriad signaling pathways that are implicated in synaptic plasticity is well studied. A recent abundance of quantitative experimental data has made the events associated with synaptic plasticity amenable to quantitative biophysical modeling. Spines are also fascinating biophysical computational units because spine geometry, signal transduction, and mechanics work in a complex feedback loop to tune synaptic plasticity. In this sense, ideas from modeling cell motility can inspire us to develop multiscale approaches for predictive modeling of synaptic plasticity. In this article, we review the key steps in postsynaptic plasticity with a specific focus on the impact of spine geometry on signaling, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and membrane mechanics. We summarize the main experimental observations and highlight how theory and computation can aid our understanding of these complex processes.

The primary target of Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) which forms dodecameric holoenzymes that are highly concentrated at the postsynaptic site. Activation of CaMKII is necessary to trigger long-term potentiation of synaptic strength (LTP), and is prolonged by autophosphorylation of subunits within the holoenzyme. Here we use MCell4, an agent-based, stochastic, modeling platform to model CaMKII holoenzymes placed within a realistic spine geometry. We show how two mechanisms of regulation of CaMKII, ‘Ca2+-calmodulin-trapping (CaM-trapping)’ and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) shape the autophosphorylation response during a repeated high-frequency stimulus. Our simulation results suggest that autophosphorylation of CaMKII does not constitute a bistable switch. Instead, prolonged but temporary, autophosphorylation of CaMKII may contribute to a biochemical-network-based ‘kinetic proof-reading” mechanism that controls induction of synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are a type of ion permeable channels playing critical roles in excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system by mediating different forms of synaptic plasticity, a mechanism thought to be the molecular basis of neuronal development, learning and memory formation. NMDARs form tetramers in the postsynaptic membrane, most generally associating two obligatory GluN1 subunits and two modulatory GluN2 (GluN2A-D) or GluN3 (GluN3A-B) subunits. In the hippocampus, the dominant GluN2 subunits are GluN2A and GluN2B, displaying different expression patterns, with GluN2B being highly expressed in early development while GluN2A levels increase gradually during postnatal development. In the forebrain, the plastic processes mediated by NMDARs, such as the adaptation of glutamate synapses and excitatory neuronal networks, mostly rely on the relative implication of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs that have different signaling properties. Although the molecular regulation of synaptic NMDARs has been under intense investigation over the last decades, the exact topology of these two subtypes within the postsynaptic membrane has remained elusive. Here we used a combination of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to characterize the surface distribution of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Both dSTORM and STED microscopy, based on different principles, enable to overcome the resolution barrier due to the diffraction limit of light. Using these techniques, we here unveil a differential nanoscale organization of native GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDARs in rat hippocampal neurons. Both NMDAR subtypes are organized in nanoscale structures (termed nanodomains) that differ in their number, area, and shape. These observed differences are also maintained in synaptic structures. During development of hippocampal cultures, the membrane organization of both NMDAR subtypes evolves, with marked changes for the topology of GluN2A-NMDARs. Furthermore, GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR nanoscale organizations are differentially affected by alterations of either interactions with PDZ scaffold proteins or CaMKII activity. The regulation of GluN2A-NMDARs mostly implicates changes in the number of receptors in fixed nanodomains, whereas the regulation of GluN2B-NMDARs mostly implicates changes in the nanodomain topography with fixed numbers of receptors. Thus, GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDARs have distinct organizations in the postsynaptic membrane, likely implicating different regulatory pathways and signaling complexes.},

NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a high affinity binding partner of CaMKII at the postsynaptic membrane. NR2B binds to the T-site of CaMKII and modulates its catalysis. By direct measurement using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that NR2B binding causes about 11 fold increase in the affinity of CaMKII for ATPγS, an analogue of ATP. ITC data is also consistent with an ordered binding mechanism for CaMKII with ATP binding the catalytic site first followed by peptide substrate. We also show that dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr286-α-CaMKII is attenuated when NR2B is bound to CaMKII. This favors the persistence of Thr286 autophosphorylated state of CaMKII in a CaMKII/phosphatase conjugate system in vitro. Overall our data indicate that the NR2B- bound state of CaMKII attains unique biochemical properties which could help in the efficient functioning of the proposed molecular switch supporting synaptic memory.},

  abstract = {Background Autophosphorylation of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at T286 generates partially Ca2+/CaM-independent “autonomous” activity, which is thought to be required for long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory. A requirement for T286 autophosphorylation also for efficient Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity has been described, but remains controversial. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to determine the contribution of T286 autophosphorylation to Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity, the activity of CaMKII wild type and its phosphorylation-incompetent T286A mutant was compared. As the absolute activity can vary between individual kinase preparations, the activity was measured in six different extracts for each kinase (expressed in HEK-293 cells). Consistent with measurements on purified kinase (from a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system), CaMKII T286A showed a mildly but significantly reduced rate of Ca2+/CaM-stimulated phosphorylation for two different peptide substrates (to ∼75–84\% of wild type). Additional slower CaMKII autophosphorylation at T305/306 inhibits stimulation by Ca2+/CaM, but occurs only minimally for CaMKII wild type during CaM-stimulated activity assays. Thus, we tested if the T286A mutant may show more extensive inhibitory autophosphorylation, which could explain its reduced stimulated activity. By contrast, inhibitory autophosphorylation was instead found to be even further reduced for the T286A mutant under our assay conditions. On a side note, the phospho-T305 antibody showed some basal background immuno-reactivity also with non-phosphorylated CaMKII, as indicated by T305/306A mutants. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity is mildly (∼1.2–1.3fold) further increased by additional T286 autophosphorylation, but that this autophosphorylation is not required for the major part of the stimulated activity. This indicates that the phenotype of CaMKII T286A mutant mice is indeed due to the lack of autonomous activity, as the T286A mutant showed no dramatic reduction in stimulated activity.},

To this end, we developed a detailed state model of CaMKII activation and autophosphorylation based on the currently available literature, and constrained it with data from CaMKII autophosphorylation essays. Our model takes exact phosphorylation patterns of CaMKII holoenzymes into account, and is valid at physiologically relevant conditions where the concentrations of calcium and calmodulin are not saturating. Our results strongly suggest that even when bound to less than fully calcium-bound calmodulin, CaMKII is in the active state, and indicate that the autophosphorylation of T286 by an active non-phosphorylated CaMKII subunit is significantly faster than by an autophosphorylated CaMKII subunit. These results imply that CaMKII can be efficiently activated at significantly lower calcium concentrations than previously thought, which may explain how CaMKII gets activated at calcium concentrations existing at synapses in vivo. We also investigated the significance of CaMKII holoenzyme structure on CaMKII autophosphorylation and obtained estimates of previously unknown binding constants.},

Whereas acute intracellular injection of catalytically active CaMKII fragments saturates LTP (Lledo et al., 1995), an autonomously active form (T286D) of CaMKII holoenzyme expressed in transgenic mice did not saturate potentiation (Mayford et al., 1995). To better understand the role of the holoenzyme in the control of synaptic strength, we transfected hippocampal neurons with constructs encoding forms of CaMKII mimicking different phosphorylation states. Surprisingly, T286D not only failed to potentiate synaptic strength, but produced synaptic depression through an long-term depression (LTD)-like process. T305/T306 phosphorylation was critical for this depression because overexpression of the pseudophosphorylated form (T286D/T305D/T306D) caused depression that occluded LTD, and overexpression of an autonomous form in which T305/T306 could not be phosphorylated (T286D/T305A/T306A) prevented LTD (instead producing potentiation). Therefore, autonomous CaMKII can lead to either LTP or LTD, depending on the phosphorylation state of the control point, T305/T306.},

Both LTP and LTD require T286 phosphorylation, but T305/306 phosphorylation selectively promoted LTD. In response to excitatory LTP versus LTD stimuli, the differential T305/306 phosphorylation directed CaMKII movement to either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, thereby coordinating plasticity at both synapse types. Fast T305/306 phosphorylation required prior T286 phosphorylation and then curbed CaMKII activity by two mechanisms: (i) a cis-subunit reaction reduced both Ca2+ stimulation and autonomous activity and (ii) a trans-subunit reaction enabled complete activity shutdown and feed-forward inhibition of further T286 phosphorylation. These are fundamental additions to the long-studied CaMKII regulation and function in neuronal plasticity.},

  abstract = {Activation of CaMKII by calmodulin and the subsequent maintenance of constitutive activity through autophosphorylation at threonine residue 286 (Thr286) are thought to play a major role in synaptic plasticity. One of the effects of autophosphorylation at Thr286 is to increase the apparent affinity of CaMKII for calmodulin, a phenomenon known as "calmodulin trapping". It has previously been suggested that two binding sites for calmodulin exist on CaMKII, with high and low affinities, respectively. We built structural models of calmodulin bound to both of these sites. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that while binding of calmodulin to the supposed low-affinity binding site on CaMKII is compatible with closing (and hence, inactivation) of the kinase, and could even favour it, binding to the high-affinity site is not. Stochastic simulations of a biochemical model showed that the existence of two such binding sites, one of them accessible only in the active, open conformation, would be sufficient to explain calmodulin trapping by CaMKII. We can explain the effect of CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 on calmodulin trapping: It stabilises the active state and therefore makes the high-affinity binding site accessible. Crucially, a model with only one binding site where calmodulin binding and CaMKII inactivation are strictly mutually exclusive cannot reproduce calmodulin trapping. One of the predictions of our study is that calmodulin binding in itself is not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of calmodulin is.},

  abstract = {Calmodulin plays a vital role in mediating bidirectional synaptic plasticity by activating either calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) at different calcium concentrations. We propose an allosteric model for calmodulin activation, in which binding to calcium facilitates the transition between a low-affinity [tense (T)] and a high-affinity [relaxed (R)] state. The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin. It also accounts for known properties of calmodulin that have been difficult to model so far, including the activity of nonsaturated forms of calmodulin (we predict the existence of open conformations in the absence of calcium), an increase in calcium affinity once calmodulin is bound to a target, and the differential activation of CaMKII and PP2B depending on calcium concentration.}

Beyond a variety of distinct mutants, these tools now include optical methods for measurement and manipulation, with the latter including light-induced inhibition, stimulation, and sequestration. Perhaps most importantly, there are now three mechanistically distinct classes of specific CaMKII inhibitors, and their combined use enables the interrogation of CaMKII functions in a manner that is powerful and sophisticated yet~also accessible.

It is enriched at the post-synaptic density (PSD), a localization which is thought to be critical for many of its proposed neuronal functions. In order to better understand the mechanisms that regulate association of CaMKII with the PSD, we compared the levels of autophosphorylation between PSD-associated kinase and kinase in other parts of the neuron. We were surprised to find that αCaMKII in a PSD-enriched fraction prepared from recovered hippocampal CA1-minislices had a relatively low level of threonine 286 (T286) phosphorylation and a relatively high level of threonine 305 (T305) phosphorylation. Furthermore, when the minislices were subjected to a treatment that mimics ischemic conditions, there was a significant translocation of αCaMKII to the PSD-enriched fraction accompanied with a dramatic reduction in T286 phosphorylation levels throughout the neuron. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of autophosphorylation in the localization of CaMKII.},

  abstract = {NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus consists of two opposing forces: long-term potentiation (LTP), which strengthens synapses and long-term depression (LTD), which weakens synapses. LTP and LTD are associated with memory formation and loss, respectively. Synaptic plasticity is controlled at a molecular level by Ca2+-mediated protein signaling. Here, Ca2+ binds the protein, calmodulin (CaM), which modulates synaptic plasticity in both directions. This is because Ca2+-bound CaM activates both LTD-and LTP-inducing proteins. Understanding how CaM responds to Ca2+ signaling and how this translates into synaptic plasticity is therefore important to understanding synaptic plasticity induction. In this paper, CaM activation by Ca2+ and calmodulin binding to downstream proteins was mathematically modeled using differential equations. Simulations were monitored with and without theoretical knockouts and, global sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how Ca2+/CaM signaling occurred at various Ca2+ signals when CaM levels were limiting. At elevated stimulations, the total CaM pool rapidly bound to its protein binding targets which regulate both LTP and LTD. This was followed by CaM becoming redistributed from low-affinity to high-affinity binding targets. Specifically, CaM was redistributed away from LTD-inducing proteins to bind the high-affinity LTP-inducing protein, calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). In this way, CaMKII acted as a dominant affecter and repressed activation of opposing CaM-binding protein targets. The model thereby showed a novel form of CaM signaling by which the two opposing pathways crosstalk indirectly. The model also found that CaMKII can repress cAMP production by repressing CaM-regulated proteins, which catalyze cAMP production. The model also found that at low Ca2+ stimulation levels, typical of LTD induction, CaM signaling was unstable and is therefore unlikely to alone be enough to induce synaptic depression. Overall, this paper demonstrates how limiting levels of CaM may be a fundamental aspect of Ca2+ regulated signaling which allows crosstalk among proteins without requiring directly interaction.},

  abstract = {Structural and biophysical studies reveal how CaMKII kinases, which are important for cellular learning and memory, are switched on by binding of Ca2+/calmodulin., CaMKII enzymes transmit calcium ion (Ca2+) signals released inside the cell by regulating signal transduction pathways through phosphorylation: Ca2+ first binds to the small regulatory protein CaM; this Ca2+/CaM complex then binds to and activates the kinase, which phosphorylates other proteins in the cell. Since CaMKs remain active long after rapid Ca2+ pulses have dropped they function as molecular switches that turn on or off crucial cell functions in response to Ca2+ levels. The multifunctional CaMKII forms of this enzyme – of which there are four in human – are important in many processes including signaling in neurons and controlling of the heart rate. They are particularly abundant in the brain where they probably play a role in memory. CaMKII forms an exceptionally large, dodecameric complex. Here, we describe the crystal structure of this complex for each of the four human CaMKII catalytic domains in their autoinhibited states, a complex of CaMKII with Ca2+/CaM, as well as the structure of the oligomerization domain (the part of the protein that mediates complex formation) in its physiological dodecameric state and in a tetradecameric state. Detailed comparison of this large body of structural data together with biophysical studies has allowed us to better understand the structural mechanisms of CaMKII activation by CaM and to explain many of the complex regulatory features of these essential enzymes.},

This leads to molecular events crucial for synaptic plasticity, such as receptor trafficking, localization and activity; actin cytoskeletal dynamics; translation; and even transcription through synapse–nucleus shuttling. Several new tools affording increasingly greater spatiotemporal resolution have revealed the link between CaMKII activity and downstream signalling processes in dendritic spines during synaptic and behavioural plasticity.

  abstract = {CaMKIIα plays an essential role in decoding Ca2+ signaling in spines by acting as a leaky Ca2+ integrator with the time constant of several seconds. However, the mechanism by which CaMKIIα integrates Ca2+ signals remains elusive. Here, we imaged CaMKIIα-CaM association in single dendritic spines using a new FRET sensor and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. In response to a glutamate uncaging pulse, CaMKIIα-CaM association increases in \textasciitilde 0.1\,s and decays over \textasciitilde 3\,s. During repetitive glutamate uncaging, which induces spine structural plasticity, CaMKIIα-CaM association did not show further increase but sustained at a constant level. Since CaMKIIα activity integrates Ca2+ signals over \textasciitilde 10\,s under this condition, the integration of Ca2+ signal by CaMKIIα during spine structural plasticity is largely due to Ca2+/CaM-independent, autonomous activity. Based on these results, we propose a simple kinetic model of CaMKIIα activation in dendritic spines.},
