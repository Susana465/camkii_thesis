## Report style and philosophy
As we go through this report, you will notice I chose to write about the personal struggles and successes throughout my PhD. Additionally, I emphasize the importance of transparency, inclusivity, and reproducibility in research. This thesis tackles some biological questions around memory at the molecular level, whilst challenging ideas of where knowledge used here comes from, and how outputs will be used. I didn’t want to highlight any scientific achievements without also acknowledging a legacy of scientific racism, speciesism, ableism or any other kind of oppression.

This report’s format and philosophy are heavily inspired by Zelenka’s thesis [@nataliezelenkaPhenotypeGenotype].
