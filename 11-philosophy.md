## Report style and philosophy
As we go through this report, you will notice here and there how I chose to write about the personal struggles and successes throughout my second year. Additionally, I also highlight and talk about some of the things I care most in research: making it transparent, inclusive, and accessible. Another unusual thing about this report is that you will see asides mentioning bias in the research I use, or potential oppressive bias on how my research could be used. This is the unfortunate reality of much of the history of the field, and I didn’t want to highlight any scientific achievements without also acknowledging a legacy of scientific racism, speciesism, ableism or any other kind of oppression.

This report’s format and philosophy are heavily inspired by Zelenka’s thesis, which you can find here [@nataliezelenkaPhenotypeGenotype]. In this section, I’ll explain a little about my approach to the work in this report. This is to add clarity about the lenses through which I did this work, as well as what I consider to be a meaningful scientific contribution.
