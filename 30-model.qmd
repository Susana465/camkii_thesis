# In Silico Model of CaMKII, NMDARs, and Associated Signalling Molecules {#sec-model-description}
Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [@holmes2000Models; @lisman2001Model; @lisman2002Molecular; @zhabotinsky2000Bistability; @lucic2008Detaileda; @stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage; @johnson2015Model; @pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin (CaM) and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry, or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer [@pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial] but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [@pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell. Incorporating spatial, temporal, and multimeric aspects is crucial because these  dimensions fundamentally shape the behavior of molecular complexes like like the CaMKII/NMDAR interaction. Spatial dynamics can reveal how the molecules interact within different cellular regions; CaMKII phosphorylation levels, as well as its functions have been shown to differ depending on its subcellular localization [@davies2007ACaMKII]. Temporal dynamics are important to understand how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions evolve over time. The duration and timing of CaMKII activation influence whether synaptic changes are transient or long-lasting, affecting the induction and maintenance of LTP and LTD.

## Previous work 
Several multi-state models of CaMKII have been proposed, each differing in focus and scope from the present one [@holmes2000Models; @lisman2001Model; @lisman2002Molecular; @zhabotinsky2000Bistability; @lucic2008Detaileda; @stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage; @johnson2015Model; @pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial]. Notably, there are multiple models by Stefan et al. [@stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage] on CaMKII which explore the dynamics between CaMKII and CaM using Stochsim simulator [@lenovere2001StochSim] which does not does not account for spatial effects, unlike MCell. These computational models provide insights into the mechanisms of calcium binding to CaM and the subsequent interaction with CaMKII, influencing the kinase’s activation, phosphorylation, and opening and closing dynamics. Notably, @pharris2019Multistate published a model that specifically examines the dynamics of CaMKII in relation to CaM using MCell. However, this study was conducted using MCell 3.3, which did not support the diffusion of multi-state molecules. In this model, CaMKII was represented as a dodecamer, though not using BNGL, and the holoenzymes themselves were non-diffusing. Instead, the authors implemented a model in which CaM could diffuse and interact with a non-diffusing multi-state representation of CaMKII.

@ordyan2020Interactions employed a BioNetGen rule-based modelling approach using Monte Carlo methods, similar to the present study, to investigate how $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signals influence CaMKII phosphorylation dynamics within the PSD. Their work primarily focuses on the interactions between CaM and the scaffolding molecule Neurogranin (Ng) in regulating CaMKII dynamics. However, their study does not investigate the crucial interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs.  

More recently, @bartol2024Spatial have published a study using the same version of MCell 4 as the model used in this PhD. Theyr use particle-based stochastic simulations in MCell4 to model the activation of CaMKII by $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ flowing through NMDARs within a postsynaptic spine. Their spatiotemporal model simulates CaMKII as a dodecamer with calcium influx through NMDARs, yet they do not directly examine interactions between NMDARs and CaMKII.

Each of these models represents a step towards the development of the present study, which advances the field by explicitly modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer that directly interacts with NMDARs on the surface of the postsynaptic dendrite.

## Model Description
In this model, CaMKII is represented as a dodecamer using BioNetGen [@sec-camkii-as-dodecamer]. The model simulates its diffusion over time and space within a postsynaptic density (PSD) volume. Other molecules involved in the system include calcium, CaM, and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and NMDARs. The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of how these reactions are modelled, highlighting their biological relevance. 

### Molecule concentrations, localization and cell volume
All molecules (except NMDARs which are surface molecules) are released from inside the cell to interact with each other. Molecules are released as discrete molecule numbers. Concentrations can be calculated as shown below in @eq-molec-concentrations-calc, where we begin with the number of molecules $N$ and convert it to moles using Avogadro's number $N_A$. Next, we account for the volume in cubic micrometers, represented as $V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)$. This equation gives us concentration in Molar.

$$
N \, \text{molecules} \times 
\frac{1 \, \text{mol}}{N_A \, \text{molecules}} \times 
\frac{1}{V(\mu \text{m}^3)} \times 
\frac{V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)}{V \, (\text{L})} = 
C_1 \, (\text{M})
$${#eq-molec-concentrations-calc}

The example calculation below considers an initial release of 10000 molecules and a dendritic volume of 0.5 µm³  (@eq-molec-concentrations-calc-example). 
$$
1*10^{4} \text{molecules} \times 
\frac{1 mol}{6.023*10^{23} \text{molecules}} \times 
\frac{1}{0.5 \, \mu \text{m}^3} \times 
\frac{1  \, \mu \text{m}^3}{10 ^{-15} \text{L}} =
3.32*10^{-6} \text{M}
$${#eq-molec-concentrations-calc-example}

CaMKII is modelled as a dodecameric molecule, which is biologically accurate. The model contains four protein species: CaM, PP1, CaMKII and NMDARS (see table of molecules included in the model). Initial molecules released inside the cell are: $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions, CaM, CaMKII and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Interactions between different molecules are modelled as rules in BNGL, where each molecule reacts according to specified conditions and kinetic rates (@fig-tbl-1). 

![Molecules released into the model, including their defined possible states specified in BioNetGen. Concentrations were calculated using Equation @eq-molec-concentrations-calc, based on a simulation volume of 0.50588 $\mu\text{m}^3$. *Note: 60 CaMKII holoenzymes, each comprising 12 subunits, correspond to a total of 720 subunits (60 × 12).](30-methods-figures\molecule-concentrations.PNG){#fig-molecule-concentrations fig-scap="Molecule concentrations in the model" fig-pos='H'}


### Biological Plausibility {#sec-validating-model}
While care was taken to compare model outputs with known biological processes described in the literature and supported by experimental data, this type of comparison is inherently complex. Different models capture different aspects of biological systems, and even subtle variations in assumptions or parameter choices can lead to divergent behaviours. As such, the evaluation of biological plausibility should be interpreted with caution; it provides useful insight, but not definitive validation. The process of matching simulated outputs—such as concentration profiles and reaction kinetics—to literature values is valuable, yet inherently limited by the variability and uncertainty present in both modelling and experimental data.

In the model presented here, reactions of cytoplasmatic molecules specified in BNGL, were placed into the geometry of a postysnaptic dendritic spine with a volume of 0.50588 $\mu\text{m}^3$, which matches the volume chosen by @ordyan2020Interactions in their model of CaMKII in the PSD and is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris et al., 1989). Moreover, Tonnesen et al. [@tonnesen2018SuperResolution] report a median spine volume of 0.1 $\mu\text{m}^3$, with some spines reaching up to 0.5~$\mu\text{m}^3$.  As such, a volume of 0.5 $\mu\text{m}^3$ is within physiologically observed bounds, albeit on the higher end of the range. 

The molecular concentrations used are also within biologically plausible ranges. For example, the initial release of 1000 $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions corresponds to a concentration of 3.28 $\mu\text{M}$. Fluorescent $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ indicator studies show resting intracellular $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ concentrations between 0.05–0.1 $\mu\text{M}$, with increases up to 100-fold during stimulation [@brette2012Handbook; @zheng2018Monitoring]. Therefore, the calcium concentrations used are within ranges of stimulated neuronal activation. I discuss this further in the discussion section and future steps of the model. 

With respect to CaMKII, concentrations of CaMKIIα subunits have been reported to range between 5 and 100 $\mu\text{M}$ in neuronal dendrites [@lee2009Activation; @feng2011Quantitative; @otmakhov2012Measuring]. NMDARs are typically found at approximately 10 to 100 receptors per synapse [@petralia2012Distribution]. In the present model, the concentrations of CaMKII and NMDARs are positioned at the lower end of these reported ranges, primarily due to the relatively large spine volume modeled. Specifically, we include 290 CaMKII subunits (equivalent to 2.36 $\mu\text{M}$) and 30 NMDARs (0.099 $\mu\text{M}$). Although the concentration of CaMKII in this model is on the lower end of reported values, this choice remains valid given the larger spine volume incorporated in the model, which dilutes the concentration of CaMKII while maintaining a reasonable estimate for its overall abundance [REFERENCE]. Furthermore, the number of NMDARs in the model is within the reported range, reinforcing the biological relevance of the simulation. The limitations of these parameter choices and potential future directions for refining this model are further discussed in the Future Directions section.

PP1 concentrations in neurons are typically reported between 1 $\mu\text{M}$ and 10 $\mu\text{M}$ [@cohen2002Protein], with CaMKII concentrations around 5 $\mu\text{M}$, yielding a literature-based ratio of approximately 5:1. In the model, PP1 is present at 0.039 $\mu\text{M}$, and CaMKII at 2.36 $\mu\text{M}$, resulting in a model ratio of about 60:1. While this higher CaMKII:PP1 ratio may exaggerate the kinase dominance. Higher PP1 concentrations should be considered in future iterations for a more accurate representation of the CaMKII:PP1 ratio, though the model remains useful for exploring activation dynamics and regulation under varying conditions.

These values are on the lower end of the reported ranges but remain within an order of magnitude of typical experimental data. This margin is reasonable, particularly given the experimental variability [@eastwood2006Minimum]. Additionally, the relative abundance of these molecules is often more important than their absolute concentrations, as it governs the signaling dynamics. The values used in this model were taken from other computational models that have been validated against experimental biological data, ensuring that the concentrations are within the expected range based on observed physiological conditions. 

These values are consistent with those found in the literature and previous models that accurately represent the biological system at hand. Albeit, because the model uses a cell volume that is on the larger side for dendritic spines, the molecular concentrations are slightly lower than what others report [@pharris2019Multistate; @yasuda2022CaMKIIa; @bartol2024Spatial]. In the future, running the model with a slightly smaller cell volume would naturally increase the total observed molecular concentrations. However, the actual behavior of the molecules is not expected to change significantly, as the relative ratios of the molecules would remain the same. Thus, the signalling dynamics are expected to be largely unaffected by such changes in concentration.

### Modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer {#sec-camkii-as-dodecamer}
In the model at hand, the individual subunits are specified in BNGL as seen in @fig-camkii-dodecamer. The components l, r, and c represent binding sites within the holoenzyme: l is a binding site on the left of the subunit, r on the right, and c is the central site interacting with an opposing subunit in the six-membered ring (@fig-camkii-dodecamer). In BNGL syntax, interactions between components are represented by a period, with a “!” (bang) followed by a number to denote specific binding. For example, a bond between the right side of one subunit and the left side of another is written as shown in @fig-camkii-dodecamer (B). The “!” is followed by any number, provided the two binding components share the same number.

Modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer using BNGL enables the representation of the molecule as multimeric, with each subunit able to adopt the following possible states:

- A CaM binding site, CaM can be bound or unbound,
- A NMDAR binding site, CaMKII can be bound or unbound to NMDARs,
- A T286 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated (T286~0) or phosphorylated (T286~P),
- A T306 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated (T306~0) or phosphorylated (T306~P),
- A status of being open (open~1) or closed (open~0).

![(A) The open flag determines whether the subunit is in a closed (0) or open (1) state. The T286 and T306 flags represent the phosphorylation states, where a value of 0 indicates the subunit is unphosphorylated, and “P” indicates phosphorylation. The cam flag refers to a binding site for CaM, which can either be bound or unbound. Similarly, the nmdar flag represents another binding site for the NMDA receptor, which can also be in a bound or unbound state. The cam and nmdar flags represent binding events that can occur or not, depending on whether CaM or NMDA receptors are bound to the subunit. (B) The left (l), right (r), and centre (c) binding sites facilitate the assembly of subunits into two hexameric rings. These rings are stabilised via interactions at the centre binding site. Subunits participating in the left and right rings are highlighted in matching colours to distinguish the respective assemblies. (C) A more visual depiction of the two separated hexameric rings. (D) The centre binding interactions are specifically highlighted to show the dodecameric representation of CaMKII in the model. ](30-methods-figures\camkii_dodecamer_bngl.PNG){#fig-camkii-dodecamer fig-scap="CaMKII dodecamer in BNGL" width="95%"}

The model includes autonomous activation of CaMKII subunits, allowing them to flicker between open and closed states when unbound to CaM and unphosphorylated at T286 (see reaction rule #5 in @fig-tbl-1). The binding of CaM or phosphorylation at T286 stabilises the open state by preventing reversion to a closed conformation. Additionally, CaM binding can only occur if the subunit is in an open state due to the structural requirements for high-affinity binding. Electron microscopy of rat $\alpha$-CaMKII in Sf9 cells [@myers2017CaMKII] suggests that fewer than 3% of CaMKII subunits adopt a compact, docked-like conformation [@bayer2019CaM]. The model therefore assumes all CaMKII to be in an undocked confirmation, in order to streamline the focus on the fundamental functional states of CaMKII. 

Each CaMKII holoenzyme diffuses through the cell volume with a specified diffusion constant of $1\times 10^{-6} \text{cm}^2/\text{s}$, which is within biological limits [@sanabria2008Spatial]. In the model, CaMKII subunits can interact with NMDA receptors located on the cell surface. When they interact, CaMKII can bind reversibly to the NMDA receptor, forming a complex in which the CaMKII subunit that has been bound remains open (see reaction rule #12 in @fig-tbl-1). As CaMKII remains open when bound to NMDARs, further reactions can happen such as phosphorylation at T286 and T305, as well as binding to CaM molecules [@fig-camkii_nmdar and @fig-camkii-binding-rxns]. 

### CaMKII and NMDAR binding
In this model, NMDARs are represented as single-site molecules, rather than as tetramers, due to the fact that the primary interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs occurs predominantly through the GluN2B subunit. While it is important to acknowledge that the GluN2B subunit is distinct from the entire NMDAR heteromer, we refer to the model as NMDAR for simplicity and clarity. This nomenclature is used as a practical approximation, since the interactions we are modelling are specifically associated with the GluN2B subunit, which is often studied in isolation in experimental settings. In many in vitro experiments, the focus is on the GluN2B subunit, and the behaviour of the whole NMDAR complex is inferred based on these more controlled interactions [@akashi2009NMDA; @goodell2014CaMKII; @barcomb2016CaMKIIa; @rumian2024LTP]. Therefore, for the purposes of this model, referring to the system as NMDAR aligns with the established experimental approach, even though the underlying interactions are predominantly occurring via the GluN2B subunit. Further developments of this model to account for a more complex NMDAR molecule are possible, as I propose in [@sec-future-directions].

![Simplified schematic of CaMKII binding to NMDARs in Compartmental BioNetGen. (A) A cell is defined with plasma membrane (PM) and cytoplasm (CP) volumes. Molecules are released as surface molecules (NMDARs) or volume molecules (rest). (B) NMDARs embedded in the PM can bind to CaMKII subunits diffusing within the cytoplasm. (C) Different subunits within the CaMKII dodecamer (simplified here as a hexamer) can independently interact with other molecules such as NMDAR or CaM. These interactions can occur simultaneously or asynchronously, allowing CaMKII to integrate multiple signals through subunit-specific states.](30-methods-figures\cbngl_camkii_nmdar.PNG){#fig-camkii_nmdar fig-scap="Simplified schematic of CaMKII binding to NMDARs in Compartmental BioNetGen" fig-pos='H' width="85%"}

Furthermore, as previously discussed in @sec-CaMKII-NMDAR-association, the precise molecular mechanism by which CaMKII binds to NMDARs is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, the literature seems to agree that CaMKII interaction with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of NMDARs plays a key role in stabilising CaMKII in its open, catalytically active conformation [@bayer2001Interaction; @bayer2006Transitionb; @ozden2022CaMKIIb; @nicoll2023Synaptic]. In our model, CaMKII may bind to an NMDAR provided that it is in the open conformation and that the receptor possesses an available CaMKII-binding site (see reaction rule 12 in TABLE-REFERENCE). Upon binding, a stable CaMKII/NMDAR complex is formed, in which the kinase remains in its active state due to the stabilisation of its open structure.

### Binding of calcium to calmodulin {#sec-binding-ca-cam}
CaM has four EF hands divided into N and C lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe, consequently CaM is modelled as being able to bind four calcium ions in our model. The N lobe binds calcium faster with lower affinity and the C lobe binds slower with higher affinity [@kawasaki2017Conformational]. Numerous models have been developed to investigate the dynamics of calcium ions binding to CaM [@stefan2008Allostericd; @pepke2010Dynamic; @gonzalez-andrade2016Insights]. @linkevicius2025Fitting examined and compared various of these models, providing a useful summary of the typical categories for modeling CaM binding to $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. The model used here falls under their proposed "scheme 3" (@fig-scheme3-cam), where calcium binds and unbinds to four separate calcium binding sites in CaM. Unlike other models that distinguish between CaM's N-terminal and C-terminal binding lobes, this project does not, as the specifics of calcium binding to CaM are beyond its scope and following "scheme 3" approach to calcium binding produces biologically relevant results while avoiding complexity, allowing us to focus on further CaMKII and NMDARs interactions.

![We model calcium binding to CaM following "scheme 3" proposed by Linkevicius et al., 2024. It is a sequential CaM scheme where each binding site is represented individually.](30-methods-figures\scheme3_cam.PNG){#fig-scheme3-cam fig-scap="Calcium binding to CaM" fig-pos='H' width="70%"}

### CaMKII subunits flicker between open and closed states {#sec-camkii-flicker}
It is well established that CaMKII subunits can exist in both open and closed conformations [@pullara2017Mechanisms; @zhang2017Opposing], even in the absence of CaM [@asciutto2021Physicalc].  While the notion that CaM induces a conformational change in CaMKII is the common view, the assumption that this binding event directly triggers subunit activation is largely based on the induced-fit model, as discussed in [@sec-cam-binding-and-t286-p]. These observations may be due to the fact that binding of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$/CaM to CaMKII is more likely when the CaMKII kinase subunits are in the open conformation.

CaMKII subunits inherently fluctuate between different conformational states (open and closed), and an alternative perspective is that CaM does not directly induce the opening of the subunit but rather stabilises the open conformation upon binding [@asciutto2021Physicalc]. This suggests that the enzyme does not strictly require CaM to transition into an open state; rather, CaM serves to stabilise and prolong this conformation, thereby sustaining enzymatic activity. From a dynamic standpoint, it is plausible that, in the absence of CaM, there exists a low probability of the subunit adopting an open conformation due to intrinsic structural fluctuations. Upon CaM binding, this equilibrium may shift, favouring the stabilisation of the open state and ultimately leading to the full activation observed in vitro [@asciutto2021Physicalc]. Accordingly, in this model, CaMKII subunits are considered to undergo spontaneous transitions between open and closed conformations (see #a in @fig-camkii-binding-rxns for schematic depiction), and the impact of CaM binding is assessed in terms of its stabilising effects on these states. 

CaM binding is not the only mechanism that can render CaMKII subunits in their open conformation. In the model used in this PhD, as per the known literature, CaMKII subunits can remain in an open conformation due to one or more of the following events:

- CaM binding: CaM binding has been shown to structurally stabilise the open conformation of the CaMKII kinase subunit, preventing the kinase domain from re-engaging with its own regulatory region, thereby maintaining the open state [@singla2001Molecular; @hoffman2011Conformational; @gaertner2004Comparative].
- T286 phosphorylation: Phosphorylation at this site occurs at the hinge region of CaMKII and prevents subunits from closing [@braun1995Multifunctional; @miller1986Regulation; @coultrap2010CaMKIIa; @buard2010CaMKII; @chang2017CaMKII]. This modification thus sustains the subunit in an open conformation, contributing to the prolonged activation of the kinase.
- NMDAR binding: Once a CaMKII subunit binds to the NMDA receptor, the interaction can stabilise the open state of the kinase. This CaMKII/NMDAR association has been shown to maintain the kinase in an active, open conformation, as discussed in @sec-CaMKII-NMDAR-association.

### Binding of CaM to CaMKII {#sec-binding-cam-camkii}
CaM bound to different amounts of calcium has been shown to bind to CaMKII with different affinities, with CaM bound to four calcium having the highest affinity [@linkevicius2025Fitting;@ordyan2020Interactions; @khan2024Realtimea].  While CaM binding to the low-affinity site is compatible with CaMKII remaining in a closed state, binding to the high-affinity site is thought to structurally prevent CaMKII from closing [@singla2001Molecular; @hoffman2011Conformational; @gaertner2004Comparative]. The literature suggestes that CaM binding in itself is not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of CaM is [@evans2009Energetics; @stefan2012Structural; @bossuyt2013Visualizing]. This is likely due to the stabilising effect of high affinity binding of CaM to CaMKII structurally keeping the kinase in its active state. 

In this model, for simplicity, we therefore assume that only fully saturated CaM with four calcium ions (CaM_Ca4) binds to open CaMKII subunits. Additionally, CaM binds to a CaMKII subunit only if T306 is dephosphorylated. The T305/T306 site lies within the CaM binding region. It has been shown that autophosphorylation at T305/T306 (T306 hereforth) impedes CaM binding, and similarly CaM binding prevents T306 phosphorylation [@rellos2010Structure]. In the model here, CaM is able to bind to CaMKII with the following rules:

- CaM must be fully saturated (bound to four calcium ions), i.e. only CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII. We assume only one high affinity binding site for CaM in each CaMKII subunit.
- CaMKII subunit must be in its open/active state.
- T306 must be unphosphorylated.

As described above in @sec-camkii-flicker when a CaMKII subunit spontaneously flickers into its active/open state CaM binding is likely to stabilize the subunit once it is already active, but does not initiate activation. Similarly, while it is commonly suggested that simultaneous binding of CaM to two neighboring subunits triggers T286 autophosphorylation, we propose that CaM's role might be more nuanced. Instead of being essential for T286 phosphorylation, CaM may stabilize the open state of CaMKII, thereby increasing the likelihood of phosphorylation. Therefore, in this model, we do not make it a requirement for CaM to be bound to neighbouring subunits for phosphorylation to happen. We consider CaM binding is not strictly necessary for autophosphorylation but rather enhances the probability of phosphorylation by maintaining subunits in their active/open state.

### CaMKII phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
The most studied phosphorylation sites on CaMKII are T286 and T305/T306. These sites are key for regulating CaMKII activity and subcellular localization at the PSD during LTP, which is of relevance for synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory [see @sec-cam-binding-and-t286-p and @sec-t305-p]. Likewise, in this study, we focus on these two sites. While other phosphorylation sites on CaMKII have been identified [@migues2006Phosphorylation; @gangopadhyay2008Regulation], their functions are not yet fully understood and are not within the scope of this study. 

### T286 phosphorylation 
I have modelled phosphorylation of T286 to occur with the condition that two adjascent CaMKII subunits are in their open states. Research shows that CaMKII subunits need to be open to expose the ATP binding site in the regulatory domain, allowing the gamma-phosphate of ATP to transfer to the threonine residue at T286 [@lou1986Activation; @hoffman2011Investigation]. The open (kinase domain available) and undocked (subunits can reach their neighbours) states of two neighbouring subunits is crucial for the catalytic site of one subunit to reach and phosphorylate its neighboring subunit. In our model, we assume ATP molecule levels are sufficient to ensure the reaction proceeds at its maximal rate (saturating), so we do not model ATP as a reactant but rather focus on the phosphorylation process under these conditions.

As discussed earlier, CaM bound to two neighbouring subunits is often referred to in the literature as being required for autophosphorylation and subsequent CaMKII activation [@nicoll2005Synaptic; @rellos2010Structureb]. CaM has been shown to keep CaMKII subunits in their open state, and therefore it may indirectly enhance probability of T286 phosphorylation. 

In the model I use here I don't make CaM a requirement for T286 phosphorylation, but rather once CaMKII is bound to CaM_Ca4, this binding keeps CaMKII subunits in their open state and further enables phosphorylation. The only requirement for CaMKII T286 phosphorylation is, therefore, that two adjacent subunits are in their open state to enable inter subunit phosphorylation at this site (as per @fig-docked-undocked previously described in @sec-biology-chapter and below in @fig-camkii-binding-rxns). 

### T306 phosphorylation
In contrast to T286 phosphorylation, T306 phosphorylation prevents binding of CaM, as the phosphate group added to the threonine creates electrostatic and steric interference, occupying the position where CaM normally interacts. In the model used here, CaM can therefore only bind to CaMKII if the T306 site is not phosphorylated, and conversely, phosphorylation at T306 cannot occur while CaM is bound (previously discussed in @sec-camkii-as-dodecamer). Similar to the conditions for T286, the model requires that a subunit must be in the open state for phosphorylation at T306 to take place. Since T286 phosphorylation maintains subunits in their open state, phosphorylation at T306 is more likely to occur if a neighboring subunit is phosphorylated at T286.

An aspect of phosphorylation at this site is that it does not prevent CaMKII subunits from closing, unlike T286 phosphorylation [@cook2021CaMKIIb]. This, together with the fact that it prevents CaM from binding, makes it more likely that subunits that are phosphorylated at T306 are found in the closed state too. When the subunit is closed, catalytic activity of the kinase is reduced, as the kinase domain is not accessible to perform catalytic activity. Therefore, this phosphorylation is ofen refered to as reducing catalytic activity of CaMKII. T306 phosphorylation may act as a form of kinetic proofreading, by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive, or less active, unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. Phosphorylation at T306 likely prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signalling in response to synaptic activity, which is discussed more in depth in [INSERT SECTION REFERENCE].

### Dephosphorylation of CaMKII subunits
There are multiple known phosphatases which act to dephosphorylate CaMKII in the PSD [@cohen1997Novel; @colbran2004Protein]. Different phosphatase proteins will carry out their function depending on their localization and what protein assemblies they are bound to or are available for them. The Ser/Thr phosphatase Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a key regulator of CaMKII signalling [@shioda2017Physiological]; and it can dephosphorylate both T286 and T306 sites of the kinase. 

The colocalization with PSD-associated PP1 or sequestration away from other protein phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 2A or protein phosphatase 2B (PP2A, PP2B), results in differential modulation of CaMKII's T286 dephosphorylation. PP1 can form a complex with over 50 regulatory or scaffolding proteins that dictate substrate specificity and subcellular localization. There are four known PP1 subunit isoforms of the catalytic subunit ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$-1, and $\gamma$-2), each interacting with over 40 known regulatory and target subunits. PP1-$\alpha$ has been shown to account for the majority of phosphatase activity with CaMKII in the PSD [@colbran2004Protein]. Therefore, we focus on PP1-$\alpha$ in this study, and refer to it simply as PP1.

In the model used here, PP1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of CaMKII without forming a stable enzyme-substrate complex. Instead, the reaction proceeds in a manner where PP1 transiently interacts, without binding, with a CaMKII subunit under specific conditions, facilitating the dephosphorylation process. PP1 can only dephosphorylate CaMKII subunits when they are unbound from CaM, as CaM structurally obstructs access to the T286 phosphorylation site. Additionally, the CaMKII subunit must be in its open conformation to expose both the T286 and T306 sites for PP1-mediated dephosphorylation. 

### Reaction rules and kinetic rates
In BNGL, reaction rules are specified as discrete transformations. For example, the rule “CaM(ca~0,camkii) + Ca() <-> CaM(ca~1,camkii)” represents the binding of a single calcium ion to CaM that is not bound to CaMKII (see reaction #1 in @fig-tbl-1). The assigned rate constants for each rule are used to calculate the probability of the reaction occurring when the two involved molecules collide, or at each time step for unimolecular transformations. 

As molecules diffuse within the simulation volume, all molecules within a specified radius along a given trajectory or at the point of collision on a surface are considered for potential reactions. For example, when a calcium ion molecule encounters a free CaM molecule at the point of collision, they react according to the specified rule in the model, resulting in the formation of the molecule CaM_Ca1. CaM_Ca1 can continue to diffuse based on the parameters defined in the simulation and can interact with other molecules as well (see back for diagram example explanation in @fig-mcell-works). 

The reaction rules defined below follow the "don't care, don't write" principle of rule-based modelling: if a molecular feature is irrelevant to a particular reaction, it is simply omitted from the reaction definition. For example, in reaction #5, which describes the flickering of CaMKII subunits between open and closed states, the conditions specified are that the subunit's CaM-binding site must be free, the subunit must be unphosphorylated at T286, and the subunit must be open. However, the phosphorylation state at T306 is irrelevant to this reaction, and therefore is not specified.

##  Validating Model Behaviour {#sec-validating-model}
To validate the model, I focused on several key aspects: first, I checked how closely the model matched biological reality and ensured it was biologically plausible. I also built the model step by step, allowing for gradual improvements and refinements. The kinetic parameters for the model’s reactions were either taken from existing literature or estimated from experimental data. When there was uncertainty, I ran parameter explorations to see how changes in the kinetic rates affected the model's behavior. 

### Incremental Construction and Stepwise Validation
In order to validate model behaviour, each reaction rule was added one at a time and tested to see if it produced biologically plausible results. Reactions or sets of reactions were introduced sequentially and tested independently. Structuring the model this way made it possible to validate individual components before integrating them into the full system. For example, the model was first tested by incorporating the calcium binding to CaM reactions. These were validated by comparing the outputs to those of a previously published and experimentally validated model [@romangarcia2017Computationala]. Once consistent behavior was observed, the next layer —CaM binding to CaMKII— was added and validated in a similar manner. Finally, interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs were introduced and tested. While a detailed account of each individual rule implementation is not provided here for the sake of conciseness, a summary of the key reaction layers and their expected outputs is presented in @tbl-model-predictions. Each row links an expected biological behaviour to its underlying model rule(s), along with an indication of whether the behaviour was observed in simulation results. These outputs not only confirm that the system produces plausible results at each stage but also serve as checkpoints for model development.

The list below presents a series of expected model behaviours that arise from specific reaction rules defined in the model, as per @fig-tbl-1 (in @sec-model-description).

### Sanity Checks
As part of the model validation process, a series of sanity checks were implemented to ensure the system behaved in accordance with known biochemical rules and structural constraints. These checks primarily aimed to verify that the model did not produce molecular species that are biologically implausible or explicitly forbidden by the reaction rules defined in the system.

Sanity checks were performed by recording observables in the BioNetGen Language (BNGL) model file. These observables are explicitly commented with justifications within the code itself and are structured to align with the logic and reaction rules outlined in @fig-tbl-1. The purpose of these observables is to serve as logical safeguards: if any of them yield a nonzero value during simulation, it indicates a breach of the model’s core assumptions or rule constraints. 

All sanity check observables listed above were expected to yield zero values, and did so consistently in simulation results. This confirms that the implemented reaction rules correctly prohibit the formation of biologically impossible species. These results are consistent and replicable; if the model is executed under the same rules and initial conditions, these observables are expected to remain zero in any future runs.

Below is a list of observables defined for sanity checks, along with a description of the corresponding molecular species, and an explanation of why their expected output should be zero under biologically valid conditions.

##### **CaMKII_CaM_Ca4_PP**
- Description: CaMKII bound to CaM (saturated with four Ca²⁺ ions), phosphorylated at both T286 and T306.
- Expected Output: 0
- Rationale: CaM binding and T306 phosphorylation are mutually exclusive. T306 lies within the CaM-binding domain of CaMKII, and its phosphorylation prevents CaM association. Thus, the coexistence of CaM and T306 phosphorylation is structurally impossible.

##### **CaMKII_CaM_Ca4_T306P1**
- Description: CaMKII bound to Ca⁴⁺-CaM, phosphorylated at T306 only.
- Expected Output: 0
- Rationale: Similar to the case above, T306 phosphorylation sterically blocks CaM binding. Therefore, this species cannot exist under correct model logic.

##### **CaMKII_CaM_closed**
- Description: CaMKII bound to CaM_Ca4 while in a closed conformation.
- Expected Output: 0
- Rationale: CaM binding induces a conformational opening of CaMKII. Thus, the closed state is incompatible with CaM-bound configurations.

##### **CaMKII_CaM_unbound_closed_T286P1**
- Description:  CaMKII phosphorylated at T286, unbound to CaM, and in a closed state.
- Expected Output: 0
- Rationale: Phosphorylation at T286 stabilizes the open conformation of CaMKII. Once phosphorylated at T286, the subunit is expected to remain open and cannot revert to the closed conformation.

##### **CaMKII_closed_complex**
- Description: CaMKII subunit is closed and bound to NMDAR forming NMDAR/CaMKII complex.
- Expected Output: 0
- Rationale: CaMKII can only bind to NMDARs if open and will remain open once bound, so none can be closed when bound in the NMDAR/CaMKII complex. 

Beyond molecular states which were expected to yield a value of zero, other sanity checks focused on conservation rules and population consistency. For example, if a simulation starts with 100 CaMKII subunits and 50% are phosphorylated at T286, the remaining 50% should be in unphosphorylated. Any deviation from this expected balance may indicate erroneous reaction pathways or state duplications. These sanity checks were observed during simulation results and cross-validated with the total molecule counts to ensure system integrity, as we will explore in @sec-results. 

### Exploration of Uncertain Parameters

As discussed in @sec-intro-comp, computational models can serve as predictive tools to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying observed biochemical processes. However, parameters such as rate constants, activation energies, diffusion coefficients, etcetera, are rarely known with precision [@sumathi2002Priori; @turanyi2012Determination; @mcdonald2022Parameter]. Consequently, predictions are typically subject to uncertainty. Thus understanding how parameter variations influence outcomes is a crucial part of model development and validation.

While other models have explored the dynamics of calcium, calmodulin, and CaMKII [@holmes2000Models; @lisman2001Model; @lisman2002Molecular; @zhabotinsky2000Bistability; @lucic2008Detaileda; @stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage; @johnson2015Model; @pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial], to the best of our knowledge none have specifically focused on the direct interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs, as is done in the present study. Consequently, determining parameters for calcium binding to CaM and CaM binding to CaMKII was relatively straightforward, as there are studies that have provided analyses and reviews of parameters that best fit biological phenomena [@linkevicius2025Fitting]. However, there were four reaction parameters that were more uncertain and key for this study: $k_\text{on}$/$k_\text{off}$ for CaMKII flicker of opening and closing (reaction rule #5 in @fig-tbl-1), and $k_\text{on}$/$k_\text{off}$ for CaMKII binding to NMDARs (reaction rule #12 in @fig-tbl-1). 

First, we examine the opening and closing kinetics of CaMKII subunits, specifically focusing on the association $k_\text{on}$ and dissociation $k_\text{off}$ rates of these two states. While most models assume that CaM binding directly induces CaMKII activation, this assumption is not applied in the current model, as discussed throughout this thesis. Instead, we use the parameters proposed by [@pharris2019Multistate], as they modeled the flickering (transient opening and closing) of CaMKII holoenzyme subunits. However, since the current model integrates parameters from multiple sources, parameter exploration was performed to ensure robust and consistent dynamics aligned with the existing literature. Specifically, we varied the opening and closing rates by factors of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 relative to the values proposed by Pharris et al. [@pharris2019Multistate], where $k_\text{off}$ = $1.00 \times 10^7$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_\text{off}$ = $2.00 \times 10^4$ $\mathrm{M}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

To ensure that the behavior of CaMKII was well-understood and stable before introducing additional complexity, I first modelled the changes in the binding kinetics of CaMKII without the inclusion of NMDARs. This approach allowed me to isolate and focus on the fundamental properties of CaMKII itself. NMDARs introduce their own kinetic properties and interactions with CaMKII, which could influence the system's behavior. By first confirming that CaMKII operates predictably in isolation, I ensured that any subsequent changes observed after introducing NMDARs could be confidently attributed to interactions between the two systems, rather than unaccounted-for variations in CaMKII dynamics. By initially focusing on CaMKII alone, I could verify that its kinetic behavior was stable and robust before layering on the complexities of NMDAR interactions. 

@fig-open-close-t286p and @fig-open-close-camca4 show the accumulation of CaMKII bound to CaM_Ca4 and CaMKII T286 phosphorylation over time, under different kinetic conditions for the opening and closing rates $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$ of CaMKII subunits. Each curve represents a simulation where $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$ were changed by factors of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 relative to baseline parameters, while keeping the equilibrium dissociation constant $k_{\text{D}}$ fixed at 500~M. Even though $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$ differ across conditions (spanning orders of magnitude), the general trajectory of molecule accumulation over time remains broadly similar. Small differences are visible: simulations with faster kinetics (higher $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$) tend to show slightly faster initial accumulation, but by the end (around 100 seconds), the molecule counts converge relatively closely across all conditions.

Across both datasets, although $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$ span orders of magnitude, the general trajectory of molecule accumulation remains broadly similar. Simulations with faster kinetics (higher $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$) show a steeper initial accumulation, reflecting more rapid binding and activation due to quicker subunit opening and closing. However, by approximately 100 seconds, the total number of bound or phosphorylated molecules converges across conditions. 

Maintaining the same $k_{\text{D}}$ isolates the effects of flickering rates on early dynamics without confounding the overall binding strength. Faster flickering enhances the speed at which steady-state is approached, but does not alter the final outcome because the underlying affinity remains the same. If $k_{\text{D}}$ were instead varied, it would affect not just the kinetics but also the steady-state occupancy, leading to fundamentally different final amounts of CaMKII-CaM complexes or T286-phosphorylated CaMKII. 

These results led to the conclusion that varying $k_\text{on}$ and $k_\text{off}$ by factors of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 did not significantly affect the system's final outcomes. The system was robust enough that these changes in flickering rates did not alter the overall behavior, making it reasonable to retain the original parameters proposed by [@pharris2019Multistate]. Since altering the rates did not drastically change the system's dynamics or steady-state outcomes, the original parameter values were kept unchanged for the final model simulations.

Similarly, parameter variations for CaMKII and NMDAR binding rates were explored to assess their impact on the model.  Specifically, a $k_\text{off}$ for the unbinding of CaMKII from the NR1 subunit of NMDARs was estimated by [@leonard2002Regulation], though to the best of our knowledge, we could not find estimated values for the GluN2B subunit, to which CaMKII binds more readily [@strack1998Autophosphorylationdependent; @leonard2002Regulation; @barria2005NMDA]. We therefore proceeded to use the parameters that were used for a previously validated model [@romangarcia2017Computationala], with a $k_{\text{D}}$ value of $1.5 \times 10^{-7} \text{M}$. We run the simulation by varying this $k_{\text{D}}$ by factor of 0.1 and 0.01.  

The objective was to determine how changes in these parameters affected the molecules in the model. Specifically, we focused on CaMKII T286 phosphorylation and CaM binding, as they had been used in previous parameter sweeps and were indirectly influenced by these changes. While direct changes such as CaMKII binding or unbinding would obviously be affected by the change in parameters that directly affect their dynamics, T286 phosphorylation and CaM binding are not directly impacted in the same way, making them suitable for testing the effects of parameter variation on the system.

After varying $k_{\text{D}}$ as described (@fig-nmdar-varying-kd-cam-ca4 and @fig-nmdar-varying-kd-camkiit286p), we found a recent paper proposing a $k_{\text{D}}$ value of $1.07 \times 10^{-7} \text{M}$. Observing that the results did not vary significantly with this new $k_{\text{D}}$ value, which was in close agreement with our original one, we proceeded with the choice of $k_{\text{D}} = 1.5 \times 10^{-7} \text{M}$.

Similarly, parameter variations for CaMKII and NMDAR binding rates were explored to assess their impact on the model. Specifically, a $k_\text{off}$ for the unbinding of CaMKII from the NR1 subunit of NMDARs was estimated by [@leonard2002Regulation]. However, to the best of our knowledge, we could not find estimated values for the GluN2B subunit, to which CaMKII binds more readily [@strack1998Autophosphorylationdependent; @leonard2002Regulation; @barria2005NMDA]. We therefore proceeded to use the parameters from a previously validated model [@romangarcia2017Computationala], with a $k_{\text{D}}$ value of $1.5 \times 10^{-7} \text{M}$. We ran the simulation by varying this $k_{\text{D}}$ by factors of 0.1 and 0.01.

Taken together, these parameter sweeps demonstrate that the model’s core behaviours, particularly CaMKII T286 phosphorylation and CaM binding, are robust to substantial variations in both flickering kinetics and CaMKII–NMDAR binding affinities. Despite exploring parameter changes across multiple orders of magnitude, the system consistently converged on similar outcomes. Based on this robustness, and the agreement with literature-based estimates, the final parameters selected were the original literature-based parameters were retained in the final model.

## Expected Model Outcomes {#sec-expected-outputs}
In addition to direct rule-by-rule validation and sanity checks,  Idefined a set of expected outcomes to assess whether the model was capable of producing emergent behaviours consistent with known biological expectations—despite these behaviours not being explicitly hardcoded. These behaviours arise not from isolated reactions, but from the interaction and timing of multiple rules within the network, offering important insight into whether the system captures the complex, context-dependent behaviour observed in vivo.

For instance, phenomena such as the sustained opening of CaMKII following transient calcium signalling are not encoded as fixed outcomes. Instead, they should emerge from the model structure if the underlying mechanisms of encoded rules are implemented correctly. Similarly, the transition from CaM-dependent to CaM-independent anchoring at NMDARs, are emergent outcomes expected to arise from the model’s rule interactions. The following emergent behaviours were not coded into the rules in @fig-tbl-1, but were expected behaviours to follow what is known in the literature. 

1. **CaMKII phosphorylation at T286 occurs regardless of CaM binding, although phosphorylation is more likely when CaM is present.** This behaviour is not explicitly hardcoded into the model, but is expected as an emergent property of the system. Both CaM binding and T286 phosphorylation stabilise the CaMKII subunit in its open conformation (rules #6 and #8), which increases the likelihood of both events co-occurring. Therefore, while the model does not directly specify this co-occurrence, the chances of T286 phosphorylation are indirectly increased when CaMKII is either already phosphorylated at T286 or bound to CaM, as both conditions promote an open state conducive to phosphorylation.

2. **When phosphorylated at T286, CaMKII binds more readily to NMDARs, independent of the presence of CaM.** This behaviour arises from the fact that T286 phosphorylation stabilises CaMKII in its open conformation, and only open CaMKII can bind to NMDARs. While the model does not explicitly encode a direct link between T286 phosphorylation and NMDAR binding, it encodes the conditions that promote each event separately. As a result, we expect that T286-phosphorylated CaMKII subunits will indirectly bind NMDARs more readily due to their maintained open state.

3. **When CaMKII is maintained in the open state by CaM binding, the kinase binds more readily to NMDARs and is likely to remain associated with the NMDAR/CaMKII complex even after CaM dissociates.** Both CaM binding and NMDAR binding stabilise CaMKII in its open conformation. The model allows multiple routes to maintaining this open state, one of them being CaM binding, hence CaM-bound CaMKII may be more likely to interact with NMDARs, and once that interaction occurs, the open conformation can be preserved by NMDAR binding alone. 

These expected behaviours serve as key indicators of the model’s capacity to recapitulate biologically realistic dynamics through rule interactions alone. How these behaviours emerge in simulation is examined in detail in @sec-discussion, where the model’s outputs are evaluated against known experimental observations.
