# Modelling CaMKII, NMDAR, and Molecular Dynamics in a Dendritic Spine

Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [REFERENCES]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex [@holmes2000Models; @lisman2001Model; @lisman2002Molecular; @zhabotinsky2000Bistability; @lucic2008Detaileda; @stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage; @johnson2015Model; @pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial]. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry, or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [@pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell, as we will see next. Incorporating spatial, temporal, and multimeric aspects is crucial because these  dimensions fundamentally shape the behavior of molecular complexes like like the CaMKII/NMDAR interaction. Spatial dynamics can reveal how the molecules interact within different cellular regions, in fact CaMKII phosphorylation levels, as well as its functions have been shown to differ depending on its subcellular localization [@davies2007ACaMKII]. Temporal dynamics are important to understand how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions evolve over time.

## Previous work 

This is not intended to be an in-depth review of existing models, but rather a summary aimed at comparing how relevant previous models relate to the model I have developed. Several multi-state models of CaMKII have been proposed, each differing in focus and scope from the present one. Notably, there are multiple models by Stefan et al. [@stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage] on CaMKII which explore the dynamics between CaMKII and CaM using Stochsim which does not does not account for spatial effects, unlike MCell. These mathematical models provide insights into the mechanisms of calcium binding to calmodulin and the subsequent interaction with CaMKII, influencing the kinase’s activation, phosphorylation, and opening and closing dynamics. Notably, @pharris2019Multistate, published a model that specifically examines the dynamics of CaMKII in relation to CaM using MCell. However, this study was conducted using MCell 3.3, which did not support the diffusion of multi-state molecules. 

@ordyan2020Interactions employ a BioNetGen rule-based modelling approach using Monte Carlo methods, similar to the present study, to investigate how Ca²⁺ signals influence CaMKII phosphorylation dynamics within the postsynaptic density (PSD). Their work primarily focuses on the interactions between CaM and the scaffolding molecule Ng in regulating CaMKII dynamics. Their model predicts that the parameters governing this leaky integration mechanism are finely tuned through interactions between Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, thereby providing a precise means of controlling synaptic sensitivity to calcium signals. However, their study does not investigate the crucial interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs.  

More recently, @bartol2024Spatial have published a study using the same version of MCell 4 as the model used in this PhD. Theyr use particle-based stochastic simulations in MCell4 to model the activation of CaMKII by Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs within a postsynaptic spine. Their spatial-temporal model simulates CaMKII as a dodecamer with calcium influx through NMDARs, yet they do not directly examine interactions between NMDARs and CaMKII.

Each of these models represents a step towards the development of the present study, which advances the field by explicitly modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer that directly interacts with NMDARs on the surface of the postsynaptic dendrite.

## Model description
As explained in [INTRO-COMP-CHAPTER] I use Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with the new MCell4 which combines the spatial simulation features of MCell3 (Kerr et al., 2008) and the rule-based, network-free simulation (NFSim) framework of BioNetGen Language (BNGL). This integration of capabilities offers a flexible and robust tool that is well-suited for investigating the kinetics of complex reactions within the space of a dendritic spine. 

I model the interactions of various molecules released inside the cell, including Ca²⁺, CaM, CaMKII, PP1, and NMDARs on the cell surface. I examine the binding dynamics of calcium to calmodulin and its subsequent interactions with CaMKII, focusing on the different states of CaMKII (open/closed, active/inactive) and the phosphorylation processes involved. _The results emphasize the importance of CaM binding to both CaMKII and NMDARs, as well as the regulatory role of phosphorylation._ 

The model was validated against biological results at various stages. First, the calcium release and subsequent binding to CaM were validated against [REFERENCES], testing the sequential binding of calcium. Next, to test for CaMKII activation, I assessed how much CaMKII flickered between active/open and inactive/closed states. Stefan et al. determined that the activation probability (in the absence of CaM and phosphorylation) is 0.002, so I set it to that. 

This flickering behavior should allow for CaM_Ca4 to bind to the open state, further stabilizing CaMKII, as observed in in vitro and in vivo studies [REFERENCES]. The stabilization of CaMKII in the open state by CaM binding is known as CaM trapping, and our model exhibits this behavior [FIGURE]. Additionally, CaMKII autophosphorylation at T286 and T306 is also modeled to showcase the regulatory functions of these sites.

The model uses a stochastic agent-based approach, where the program tracks only the reactions that occur between existing discrete molecules during the simulation (network-free simulation [119, 120]). A key aspect of this approach is that the number of different states present can be much smaller than the total number of possible states. Generally, stochastic simulations are preferred when the number of particles of a chemical species is small. When the assumption of continuous concentration fails due to limited populations of reactants in a small cellular environment, the ODE representation fails and stochastic simulations are particularly useful.

## Modelling CaMKII and NMDARs 
Modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer using BNGL enables the representation of the molecule as multimeric, with each subunit able to adopt the following possible states:

- A calmodulin binding site, calmodulin can be bound or unbound
- A NMDAR binding site, CaMKII can be bound or unbound to NMDARs
- A T286 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated or phosphorylated,
- A T306 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated or phosphorylated,
- A status of being open or closed.

![CaMKII dodecamer in BNGL](30-methods-figures\camkii_dodecamer_bngl.PNG){#fig-camkii_bngl width="95%"}

The model includes autonomous activation of CaMKII subunits, allowing them to flicker between open and closed states when unbound to CaM and unphosphorylated at T286 (see @sec-binding-cam-camkii). The binding of CaM or phosphorylation at T286 stabilises the open state by preventing reversion to a closed conformation. Additionally, CaM binding can only occur if the subunit is in an open state due to the structural requirements for high-affinity binding. Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells (Myers et al., 2017) suggests that fewer than 3% of CaMKII subunits adopt a compact, docked-like conformation (Figure 6). The model therefore assumes all CaMKII to be in an undocked confirmation, in order to streamline the focus on the fundamental functional states of CaMKII.

Each CaMKII subunit diffuses through the cell volume with a specified diffusion constant of [ENTER VALUE], which is within biological limits. CaMKII subunits can interact with NMDA receptors located on the cell surface. When they interact, CaMKII can bind reversibly to the NMDA receptor, forming a complex in which the CaMKII subunit that has been bound remains open. 

As CaMKII remains open when bound to NMDARs, further reactions can happen such as phosphorylation at T286 and T305, as well as binding to CaM molecules. I need to double check if CaM can bind to the bound camkii subunit, or to others but not to the already bound one. equally if cam can actually bind to camkii/nmdar complex. 

![Compartmental BioNetGen cell with plasma membrane (PM) and cytoplasm (CP). Molecules are released as surface molecules (NMDARs) or volume molecules (rest).](30-methods-figures\cbngl_camkii_nmdar.PNG){#fig-cbngl width="95%"}

In this model, the NMDARs are represented as single-site molecules, rather than as tetramers, due to the fact that the primary interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs occurs predominantly through the GluN2B subunit. While it is important to acknowledge that the GluN2B subunit is distinct from the entire NMDAR heteromer, we refer to the model as NMDAR for simplicity and clarity. This nomenclature is used as a practical approximation, since the interactions we are modelling are specifically associated with the GluN2B subunit, which is often studied in isolation in experimental settings.In many in vitro experiments, the focus is on the GluN2B subunit, and the behaviour of the whole NMDAR complex is inferred based on these more controlled interactions. Therefore, for the purposes of this model, referring to the system as NMDAR aligns with the established experimental approach, even though the underlying interactions are predominantly occurring via the GluN2B subunit. Further developments of this model to account for a more complex NMDAR molecule are possible, as I propose in [DISCUSSION SECTION].

### Molecule concentrations, localization and cell volume
All molecules, except NMDARs which are surface molecules, were released from inside the cell to interact with each other [FIGURE REFERENCE]. Due to the stochastic nature of MCell simulations, molecules are released as discrete molecule numbers. Concentrations can be calculated as shown below in @eq-molec-concentrations-calc, where we begin with the number of molecules $N$ and convert it to moles using Avogadro's number $N_A$. Next, we account for the volume in cubic micrometers, represented as $V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)$. This equation gives us concentration in Molar, which we then convert to micromolar $C_2$ after applying the unit conversions and adjusting for the volume and number of molecules. 

$$
N \, \text{molecules} \times 
\frac{1 \, \text{mol}}{N_A \, \text{molecules}} \times 
\frac{1}{V(\mu \text{m}^3)} \times 
\frac{V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)}{V \, (\text{L})} = 
C_1 \, (\text{M}) \times \frac{V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)}{C \, (\text{M})} = 
C_2 \, (\mu \text{M})
$${#eq-molec-concentrations-calc}

The example calculation below considers an initial release of 10000 molecules and a dendritic volume of 0.5 µm³  (@eq-molec-concentrations-calc-example). 
$$
1*10^{4} \text{molecules} \times 
\frac{1 mol}{6.023*10^{23} \text{molecules}} \times 
\frac{1}{0.5 \, \mu \text{m}^3} \times 
\frac{1  \, \mu \text{m}^3}{10 ^{-15} \text{L}} =
3.32*10^{-6} \text{M} \times 
\frac{10^{6}\mu \text{m}^3}{1 \text{M}} =
33.2 \mu \text{M}
$${#eq-molec-concentrations-calc-example}

The molecule concentrations in this model fall within ranges previously reported in the literature. Specifically, 10000 molecules of Ca²⁺ were released initially, corresponding to an initial [Ca²⁺] of 33.2 µM (Figure 5). Prior studies employing fluorescent Ca²⁺ indicators have shown resting intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca²⁺]i) within 50-100 nM, with increases up to 100-fold under stimulated conditions (Grienberger et al., 2012; Maravall et al., 2000). Reported intracellular [CaM] concentrations, ranging from 8 to 250 µM, align with the values observed here (initial concentration: 6.64 µM) (Black et al., 2004; Kakiuchi et al., 1982). 

In the model presented here, reactions of cytoplasmatic molecules specified in BNGL, were placed into the geometry of a postysnaptic dendritic spine with a volume of aproximately 0.5μm3, which is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris et al., 1989). 

The model is ran with CaMKII as a dodecameric molecule, which is biologically accurate. The model contains four protein species: CaM, PP1, CaMKII and NMDARS (see table of molecules included in the model). Initial molecules released inside the cell are: Ca2+ ions, CaM, CaMKII and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Since four calcium ions are needed to fully saturate CaM (CaM_Ca4) [REFERENCES], five times more calcium than CaM and CaMKII was released to ensure it would not be a limiting factor [TABLE REFERENCE]. An insufficient amount of calcium would limit the formation of fully active CaM, thereby reducing its ability to activate CaMKII. This could introduce an unintended bottleneck in the signalling cascade, making it difficult to accurately study CaMKII activation, autophosphorylation, or its downstream effects. Interactions between different molecules are modelled as rules in BNGL (as explained in CHAPTER REFERENCE), where each molecule reacts according to certain conditions and kinetic rates. 

## Reaction rules and kinetic rates
In BNGL, reaction rules are specified as discrete transformations. For example, the rule “CaM(ca~0,camkii) + Ca() <-> CaM(ca~1,camkii)” represents the binding of a single calcium ion to Calmodulin that is not bound to CaMKII (see reaction #1 in @fig-rxns-table1). The assigned rate constants for each rule are used to calculate the probability of the reaction occurring when the two involved molecules collide, or at a specific time step for unimolecular transformations. 

As molecules diffuse within the simulation volume, all molecules within a specified radius along a given trajectory or at the point of collision on a surface are considered for potential reactions. For example, when a calcium ion molecule encounters a free CaM molecule at the point of collision, they react according to the specified rule in the model, resulting in the formation of the molecule CaM_Ca1. CaM_Ca1 can continue to diffuse based on the parameters defined in the simulation and can interact with other molecules as well. During runtime, a random seed number generator is initialized with a seed number for each simulation. This generator selects a sequence of random numbers that determines the probabilities of transformations throughout the simulation. To gain a deeper understanding of the reactions, they are described in detail below.

### Binding of calcium to calmodulin {.unnmbered #sec-binding-ca-cam}
The binding of calcium to CaM is represented in reaction rules number 1 to number 4 in TABLE-OF-REACTIONS. CaM has four EF hands divided into N and C lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe, consequently CaM is modelled as being able to bind four calcium ions in our model. The N lobe binds calcium faster with lower affinity and the C lobe binds slower with higher affinity [REFERENCES]. Numerous models have been developed to investigate the dynamics of calcium binding to CaM [REFERENCES]. Linkevicius et al. (2024) examined and compared various of these models, providing a useful summary of the typical categories for modeling CaM binding to Ca2+. The model used here falls under their proposed "scheme 3" (@fig-scheme3-cam), where calcium binds and unbinds to four separate calcium binding sites in calmodulin. Unlike other models that distinguish between CaM's N-terminal and C-terminal binding lobes, this project does not, as the specifics of calcium binding to calmodulin are beyond its scope and following "scheme 3" approach to calcium binding produces biologically relevant results while avoiding complexity, allowing us to focus on further CaMKII and NMDARs interactions.

![We model calcium binding to calmodulin following "scheme 3" proposed by Linkevicius et al., 2024. It is a sequential calmodulin scheme where each binding site is represented individually.

### CaMKII subunits flicker between open and closed states


### Binding of calmodulin to CaMKII {.unnmbered #sec-binding-cam-camkii}
This binding is represented in reaction rule number 6, and the dissociation of these two molecules is represented by reaction rule number 7, as per TABLE-OF-REACTIONS. CaM bound to different amounts of calcium has been shown to bind to CaMKII with different affinities, with calmodulin bound to four calcium having the highest affinity [REFERENCE]. In this model, for simplicity, we therefore assume that only fully saturated CaM with four calciums binds to open CaMKII subunits. Additionally, CaM binds to a CaMKII subunit only if T306 is dephosphorylated. The T305/T306 site lies within the CaM binding region. It has been shown that autophosphorylation at T305/T306 impedes CaM binding, and similarly CaM binding prevents T306 phosphorylation [26] [@rellos2010Structure]. In the model here, CaM is able to bind to CaMKII with the following rules:

- CaM must be fully saturated (bound to four calcium ions), i.e. only CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII. We assume only one high affinity binding site for CaM in each CaMKII subunit.
- CaMKII subunit must be in its open/active state.
- T306 must be unphosphorylated.

It has been suggested that there are both low- and high-affinity binding sites for calmodulin within the regulatory domain of a CaMKII subunit [REFERENCES]. While CaM binding to the low-affinity site is compatible with CaMKII remaining in a closed state, binding to the high-affinity site is thought to structurally prevent CaMKII from closing (Stefan et al., 2012, MORE REFERENCES). If CaM initially binds to the low-affinity site while the kinase is inactive/closed, it might "slide" along residues 291-312 to the higher-affinity site, thereby shifting the CaMKII subunit into its open/active state (need REFERENCE?). Once bound to this high-affinity site, CaM prevents the subunit from returning to its closed state, maintaining its active conformation.

Stefan et al., 2012 predicted that calmodulin binding in itself was not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of calmodulin is. [HAS THIS BEEN CONFIRMED IN ANY STUDIES] Likely due to the stabilising effect of high affinity binding of CaM to CaMKII structurally keeping the kinase in its active state. Additionally, T286 phosphorylation has been shown to also stabilise CaMKII in an active state, therefore making the high-affinity binding site accessible [REFERENCE]. 

In fact, stochastic simulations of a biochemical model showed that two such binding sites, with only one of them accessible in the active, open conformation, could be sufficient to explain calmodulin trapping by CaMKII [reference from stefan et al., 2012]. In the model used in this PhD project, I propose that CaM can remain bound and in a "trapped" position without modelling the low affinity binding site. CaM-trapping happens as CaM binding affinity increases with CaMKII subunit phosphorylation at T286 (REFERENCE), and CaM therefore remains bound to CaMKII subunits for longer. In a dynamic interplay, as autophosphorylation promoted CaM trapping, CaM trapping has also been proposed to lead to an enhanced, non-linear increase in autophosphorylation of CaMKII during high-frequency synaptic stimulations (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998; Nicoll and Schulman, 2023; Putney, 1998).

As described through the induced fit versus conformational change modes of molecule binding [BIOLOGY CHAPTER], the literature often describes CaM binding through the induced fit lense of CaM inducing CaMKII activation. However, this is not necessarily the case. When a CaMKII subunit spontaneously flickers into its active/open state CaM binding is likely to stabilize the subunit once it is already active, but not to initiate activation. Similarly, while it is commonly suggested that simultaneous binding of CaM to two neighboring subunits triggers T286 autophosphorylation, we propose that CaM's role might be more nuanced. Instead of being essential for T286 phosphorylation, CaM may stabilize the open state of CaMKII, thereby increasing the likelihood of phosphorylation. Therefore, in this model, we do not make it a requirement for CaM to be bound to neighbouring subunits for phosphorylation to happen. We consider CaM binding is not strictly necessary for autophosphorylation but rather enhances the probability of phosphorylation by maintaining subunits in their active/open state.

### CaMKII phosphorylation and dephosphorylation {.unnmbered}
The most studied phosphorylation sites on CaMKII are Thr286 and Thr305/Thr306. These sites are key for regulating CaMKII activity and subcellular localization at the PSD during LTP, which is of relevance for synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory [REFERENCES]. Likewise, in this study, we focus on these two sites. While other phosphorylation sites on CaMKII have been identified [REFERENCES], their functions are not yet fully understood and are not within the scope of this study. 

### T286 phosphorylation {.unnmbered}
I have modelled phosphorylation of T286 (reaction rule number 8) to occur with the condition that two adjascent CaMKII subunits are in their open states. Research shows that CaMKII subunits need to be open to expose the ATP binding site in the regulatory domain, allowing the gamma-phosphate of ATP to transfer to the threonine residue at T286. The open (kinase domain available) and undocked (subunits can reach their neighbours) states of two neighbouring subunits is crucial for the catalytic site of one subunit to reach and phosphorylate its neighboring subunit. In our model, we assume ATP molecule levels are sufficient to ensure the reaction proceeds at its maximal rate (saturating), so we do not model ATP as a reactant but rather focus on the phosphorylation process under these conditions.

Calmodulin bound to two neighbouring subunits is often referred to in the literature as being required for autophosphorylation (REFERENCES). As calmodulin has been shown to keep CaMKII subunits in their open state, and therefore it may indirectly enhance probability of T286 phosphorylation. In the model I use here I don't make calmodulin a requirement for T286 phosphorylation, but rather once CaMKII is bound to CaM_Ca4, this binding keeps CaMKII subunits in their open state and further enables phosphorylation.

Autophosphorylation at threonine 286 (T286) and calmodulin (CaM) binding engage in a dynamic, reciprocal interaction, where each event amplifies the other, leading to a finely tuned regulation of CaMKII activity. Phosphorylation at T286 exposes key residues, phenylalanine (F) and glutamine (N), within the CaM-binding domain, which significantly enhances CaM's binding affinity, reportedly increasing it by 10- to 1000-fold [REFERENCES]. This enhanced binding phenomenon, termed CaM-trapping, is thought to facilitate further autophosphorylation of CaMKII. Notably, autophosphorylation allows for sustained kinase activity even after CaM dissociates from CaMKII [REFERENCES].

### T305/T306 phosphorylation {.unnmbered}
In contrast to T286 phosphorylation, T305/T306 (T306 hereforth) phosphorylation prevents binding of CaM, as the phosphate group added to the threonine creates electrostatic and steric interference, occupying the position where CaM normally interacts. In the model used here, as per reaction rule number 9, CaM can therefore only bind to CaMKII if the T306 site is not phosphorylated, and conversely, phosphorylation at T306 cannot occur while CaM is bound. Similar to the conditions for T286, the model requires that a subunit must be in the open state for phosphorylation at T306 to take place. Since T286 phosphorylation maintains subunits in their open state, transphosphorylation at T306 is more likely to occur if a neighboring subunit is phosphorylated at T286.

An aspect of phosphorylation at this site is that it does not prevent CaMKII subunits from closing, unlike T286 phosphorylation. This, together with the fact that it prevents CaM from binding, makes it more likely that subunits that are phosphorylated at T306 are found in the closed state too. When the subunit is closed, catalytic activity of the kinase is reduced, as the kinase domain is not accessible to perform catalytic activity. Therefore, this phosphorylation is ofen refered to as reducing catalytic activity of CaMKII. T306 phosphorylation may act as a form of kinetic proofreading, by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive, or less active, unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. Phosphorylation at T306 likely prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signalling in response to synaptic activity, which is discussed more in depth in [INSERT SECTION].

### Dephosphorylation of CaMKII subunits {.unnmbered}
There are multiple known phosphatases which act to dephosphorylate CaMKII in the PSD [REFERENCES]. Different dephosphatase proteins will carry their function depending on their localization and what protein assemblies they are bound to or are available for them. Importantly, the Ser/Thr phosphatase Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a key regulator of CaMKII signalling [REFERENCES]; and it can dephosphorylate both T286 and T306 sites of the kinase. 

The colocalization with PSD-associated PP1 or sequestration away from PP2A may be attributable to CaMKII interactions with specific PSD proteins, resulting in differential modulation of Thr286 dephosphorylation. PP1 can form a complex with over 50 regulatory or scaffolding proteins that dictate substrate specificity and subcellular localization. There are four known PP1 subunit isoforms of the catalytic subunit (α, β, γ1, and γ2), each interacting with over 40 known regulatory and/or target subunits. PP1α has been shown to account for the majority of phosphatase actvity with CaMKII in the PSD [REFERENCE]. Therefore, we focus on PP1α in this study. 

In the model used here, PP1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of CaMKII without forming a stable enzyme-substrate complex. Instead, the reaction proceeds in a manner where PP1 transiently interacts, without binding, with a CaMKII subunit under specific conditions, facilitating the dephosphorylation process. PP1 can only dephosphorylate CaMKII subunits when they are unbound from calmodulin (CaM), as CaM structurally obstructs access to the T286 phosphorylation site. Additionally, the CaMKII subunit must be in its open conformation to expose both the T286 and T306 sites for PP1-mediated dephosphorylation. 

### CaMKII and NMDAR binding {.unnmbered}

As presented in [INTRO-BIO-CHAPTER], research seems to point to CaMKII and NMDARs interaction in the PSD to be a key mediator of LTP. So much so that in fact it has recently been suggested that CaMKII and NMDAR binding may be a minimal requirement for LTP in dendritic spines. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction remains debated. 

One proposed mechanism is that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of NMDAR, which shares homology with CaMKII's regulatory segment, binds to the kinase domain, potentially displacing the regulatory region. A long-standing hypothesis to explain how the CTD maintains CaMKII in its active state suggests that one end of the GluN2B CTD wedges at the T-site of CaMKII, preventing autoinhibition, while the other end remains loosely bound to the kinase's active site (or S site). Recent crystal structure studies, however, challenge this two-site model, revealing that substrates like GluN2B bind to a single continuous site across the kinase domain. This interaction involves a salt bridge that enhances CaMKII's affinity for activator peptides and sustains its active conformation. @ozden2022CaMKIIb propose that GluN2B binding triggers a conformational change that rotates the αD helix in the kinase domain outward, stabilizing the enzyme in its active state and preventing re-association of the regulatory segment, thereby maintaining CaMKII's catalytic activity.

In the midst of this uncertainty, it is well-established that CaMKII binds to the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, a critical interaction that stabilizes CaMKII in its open, active conformation. In this model, CaMKII is capable of associating with an NMDAR, provided CaMKII is in its open conformation and that the receptor has a free CaMKII binding site (see reaction rule number 12 in TABLE-REFERENCE). Once bound, the CaMKII/NMDAR complex is formed, maintaining the kinase in its active state by stabilizing its open conformation.
