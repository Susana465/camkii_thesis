# Computer Modelling of CaMKII and NMDARs {#sec-model-description}
Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [@holmes2000Models; @lisman2001Model; @lisman2002Molecular; @zhabotinsky2000Bistability; @lucic2008Detaileda; @stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage; @johnson2015Model; @pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin (CaM) and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry, or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer [@pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial] but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [@pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell. Incorporating spatial, temporal, and multimeric aspects is crucial because these  dimensions fundamentally shape the behavior of molecular complexes like like the CaMKII/NMDAR interaction. Spatial dynamics can reveal how the molecules interact within different cellular regions; CaMKII phosphorylation levels, as well as its functions have been shown to differ depending on its subcellular localization [@davies2007ACaMKII]. Temporal dynamics are important to understand how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions evolve over time. The duration and timing of CaMKII activation influence whether synaptic changes are transient or long-lasting, affecting the induction and maintenance of LTP and LTD.

## Previous work 
Several multi-state models of CaMKII have been proposed, each differing in focus and scope from the present one [@holmes2000Models; @lisman2001Model; @lisman2002Molecular; @zhabotinsky2000Bistability; @lucic2008Detaileda; @stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage; @johnson2015Model; @pharris2019Multistate; @ordyan2020Interactions; @bartol2024Spatial]. Notably, there are multiple models by Stefan et al. [@stefan2008Allostericd; @stefan2011MultiStage] on CaMKII which explore the dynamics between CaMKII and CaM using Stochsim simulator [@lenovere2001StochSim] which does not does not account for spatial effects, unlike MCell. These computational models provide insights into the mechanisms of calcium binding to CaM and the subsequent interaction with CaMKII, influencing the kinase’s activation, phosphorylation, and opening and closing dynamics. Notably, @pharris2019Multistate published a model that specifically examines the dynamics of CaMKII in relation to CaM using MCell. However, this study was conducted using MCell 3.3, which did not support the diffusion of multi-state molecules. In this model, CaMKII was represented as a dodecamer, though not using BNGL, and the holoenzymes themselves were non-diffusing. Instead, the authors implemented a model in which CaM could diffuse and interact with a non-diffusing multi-state representation of CaMKII.

@ordyan2020Interactions employed a BioNetGen rule-based modelling approach using Monte Carlo methods, similar to the present study, to investigate how $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signals influence CaMKII phosphorylation dynamics within the postsynaptic density (PSD). Their work primarily focuses on the interactions between CaM and the scaffolding molecule Nuerogranin (Ng) in regulating CaMKII dynamics. However, their study does not investigate the crucial interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs.  

More recently, @bartol2024Spatial have published a study using the same version of MCell 4 as the model used in this PhD. Theyr use particle-based stochastic simulations in MCell4 to model the activation of CaMKII by $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ flowing through NMDARs within a postsynaptic spine. Their spatiotemporal model simulates CaMKII as a dodecamer with calcium influx through NMDARs, yet they do not directly examine interactions between NMDARs and CaMKII.

Each of these models represents a step towards the development of the present study, which advances the field by explicitly modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer that directly interacts with NMDARs on the surface of the postsynaptic dendrite.

### Molecule concentrations, localization and cell volume
All molecules (except NMDARs which are surface molecules) are released from inside the cell to interact with each other. Molecules are released as discrete molecule numbers. Concentrations can be calculated as shown below in @eq-molec-concentrations-calc, where we begin with the number of molecules $N$ and convert it to moles using Avogadro's number $N_A$. Next, we account for the volume in cubic micrometers, represented as $V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)$. This equation gives us concentration in Molar.

$$
N \, \text{molecules} \times 
\frac{1 \, \text{mol}}{N_A \, \text{molecules}} \times 
\frac{1}{V(\mu \text{m}^3)} \times 
\frac{V \, (\mu \text{m}^3)}{V \, (\text{L})} = 
C_1 \, (\text{M})
$${#eq-molec-concentrations-calc}

The example calculation below considers an initial release of 10000 molecules and a dendritic volume of 0.5 µm³  (@eq-molec-concentrations-calc-example). 
$$
1*10^{4} \text{molecules} \times 
\frac{1 mol}{6.023*10^{23} \text{molecules}} \times 
\frac{1}{0.5 \, \mu \text{m}^3} \times 
\frac{1  \, \mu \text{m}^3}{10 ^{-15} \text{L}} =
3.32*10^{-6} \text{M}
$${#eq-molec-concentrations-calc-example}

In the model presented here, reactions of cytoplasmatic molecules specified in BNGL, were placed into the geometry of a postysnaptic dendritic spine with a volume of 0.50588 $\mu\text{m}^3$,  which matches the volume chosen by @ordyan2020Interactions in their model of CaMKII in the PSD and is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris et al., 1989). Moreover, Tonnesen et al. (2018) report a median spine volume of 0.1 $\mu\text{m}^3$, with some spines reaching up to 0.5~$\mu\text{m}^3$.  As such, a volume of 0.5 $\mu\text{m}^3$ is within physiologically observed bounds, albeit on the higher end of the range. 

The molecular concentrations used in this model fall within physiologically plausible ranges reported in the literature. For example, the initial release of 1000 $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions corresponds to a concentration of 3.28 $\mu\text{M}$. Prior studies employing fluorescent $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ indicators have shown resting intracellular $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ concentrations ([$\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$]$_i$) in the range of 0.05–0.1 $\mu\text{M}$, with increases up to 100-fold under stimulated conditions (Grienberger et al., 2012; Maravall et al., 2000). As such, the calcium input concentrations used in this model are consistent with the expected values under simulated conditions. Similarly, while the concentration of calmodulin (CaM) can vary widely in different studies, ranging from 0.1 $\mu\text{M}$ to 8 $\mu\text{M}$, with some reports extending up to 250 $\mu\text{M}$, the concentration of 0.98 $\mu\text{M}$ used in this model falls within these reported ranges. A more in depth discussion of the validity of chosen values and potential limitations is provided in @sec-validating-model. 

CaMKII is modelled as a dodecameric molecule, which is biologically accurate. The model contains four protein species: CaM, PP1, CaMKII and NMDARS (see table of molecules included in the model). Initial molecules released inside the cell are: $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions, CaM, CaMKII and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Since four calcium ions are needed to fully saturate CaM (CaM_Ca4) [REFERENCES], five times more calcium than CaM and CaMKII was released to ensure it would not be a limiting factor [TABLE REFERENCE]. An insufficient amount of calcium would limit the formation of fully active CaM, thereby reducing its ability to activate CaMKII. This could introduce an unintended bottleneck in the signalling cascade, making it difficult to accurately study CaMKII activation, autophosphorylation, or its downstream effects. Interactions between different molecules are modelled as rules in BNGL (as explained in CHAPTER REFERENCE), where each molecule reacts according to certain conditions and kinetic rates.

## Reaction rules and kinetic rates
In BNGL, reaction rules are specified as discrete transformations. For example, the rule “CaM(ca~0,camkii) + Ca() <-> CaM(ca~1,camkii)” represents the binding of a single calcium ion to CaM that is not bound to CaMKII (see reaction #1 in @fig-tbl-1). The assigned rate constants for each rule are used to calculate the probability of the reaction occurring when the two involved molecules collide, or at each time step for unimolecular transformations. 

As molecules diffuse within the simulation volume, all molecules within a specified radius along a given trajectory or at the point of collision on a surface are considered for potential reactions. For example, when a calcium ion molecule encounters a free CaM molecule at the point of collision, they react according to the specified rule in the model, resulting in the formation of the molecule CaM_Ca1. CaM_Ca1 can continue to diffuse based on the parameters defined in the simulation and can interact with other molecules as well. During runtime, a random seed number generator is initialized with a seed number for each simulation. This generator selects a sequence of random numbers that determines the probabilities of transformations throughout the simulation. To gain a deeper understanding of the reactions, they are described in detail below.

![Table of reactions](30-methods-figures\table_rxns1.PNG){#fig-tbl-1 fig-pos='H'}


## Modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer {#sec-camkii-as-dodecamer}
In the model at hand, the individual subunits are specified in BNGL as follows: `CaMKII(open~0~1,T286~0~P,T306~0~P,cam,nmdar,l,r,c)` The components l, r, and c represent binding sites within the holoenzyme: l is a binding site on the left of the subunit, r on the right, and c is the central site interacting with an opposing subunit in the six-membered ring (@fig-camkii-dodecamer). In BNGL syntax, interactions between components are represented by a period, with a “!” (bang) followed by a number to denote specific binding. For example, a bond between the right side of one subunit and the left side of another is written as shown in @fig-camkii-dodecamer (B). The “!” is followed by any number, provided the two binding components share the same number.

Modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer using BNGL enables the representation of the molecule as multimeric, with each subunit able to adopt the following possible states:

- A CaM binding site, CaM can be bound or unbound,
- A NMDAR binding site, CaMKII can be bound or unbound to NMDARs,
- A T286 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated (T286~0) or phosphorylated (T286~P),
- A T306 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated (T306~0) or phosphorylated (T306~P),
- A status of being open (open~1) or closed (open~0).

![(A) The open flag determines whether the subunit is in a closed (0) or open (1) state. The T286 and T306 flags represent the phosphorylation states, where a value of 0 indicates the subunit is unphosphorylated, and “P” indicates phosphorylation. The cam flag refers to a binding site for CaM, which can either be bound or unbound. Similarly, the nmdar flag represents another binding site for the NMDA receptor, which can also be in a bound or unbound state. The cam and nmdar flags represent binding events that can occur or not, depending on whether CaM or NMDA receptors are bound to the subunit. (B) (B) The left (l), right (r), and centre (c) binding sites facilitate the assembly of subunits into two hexameric rings. These rings are stabilised via interactions at the centre binding site.

(D) The centre binding interactions are specifically highlighted to show the dodecameric representation of CaMKII in the model. ](30-methods-figures\camkii_dodecamer_bngl.PNG){#fig-camkii-dodecamer fig-scap="CaMKII dodecamer in BNGL" width="95%"}

The model includes autonomous activation of CaMKII subunits, allowing them to flicker between open and closed states when unbound to CaM and unphosphorylated at T286 (see reaction rule #5 in @fig-tbl-1). The binding of CaM or phosphorylation at T286 stabilises the open state by preventing reversion to a closed conformation. Additionally, CaM binding can only occur if the subunit is in an open state due to the structural requirements for high-affinity binding. Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells [@myers2017CaMKII] suggests that fewer than 3% of CaMKII subunits adopt a compact, docked-like conformation [@bayer2019CaM]. The model therefore assumes all CaMKII to be in an undocked confirmation, in order to streamline the focus on the fundamental functional states of CaMKII. 

Each CaMKII holoenzyme diffuses through the cell volume with a specified diffusion constant of $1\times 10^{-6} \text{cm}^2/\text{s}$, which is within biological limits [@sanabria2008Spatial]. In the model, CaMKII subunits can interact with NMDA receptors located on the cell surface. When they interact, CaMKII can bind reversibly to the NMDA receptor, forming a complex in which the CaMKII subunit that has been bound remains open (see reaction rule #12 in @fig-tbl-1). As CaMKII remains open when bound to NMDARs, further reactions can happen such as phosphorylation at T286 and T305, as well as binding to CaM molecules [@fig-camkii_nmdar and @fig-camkii-binding-rxns]. 

In this model, NMDARs are represented as single-site molecules, rather than as tetramers, due to the fact that the primary interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs occurs predominantly through the GluN2B subunit. While it is important to acknowledge that the GluN2B subunit is distinct from the entire NMDAR heteromer, we refer to the model as NMDAR for simplicity and clarity. This nomenclature is used as a practical approximation, since the interactions we are modelling are specifically associated with the GluN2B subunit, which is often studied in isolation in experimental settings. In many in vitro experiments, the focus is on the GluN2B subunit, and the behaviour of the whole NMDAR complex is inferred based on these more controlled interactions [@akashi2009NMDA; @goodell2014CaMKII; @barcomb2016CaMKIIa; @rumian2024LTP]. Therefore, for the purposes of this model, referring to the system as NMDAR aligns with the established experimental approach, even though the underlying interactions are predominantly occurring via the GluN2B subunit. Further developments of this model to account for a more complex NMDAR molecule are possible, as I propose in [@sec-future-directions].

### Binding of calcium to calmodulin {#sec-binding-ca-cam}
CaM has four EF hands divided into N and C lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe, consequently CaM is modelled as being able to bind four calcium ions in our model. The N lobe binds calcium faster with lower affinity and the C lobe binds slower with higher affinity [@kawasaki2017Conformational]. Numerous models have been developed to investigate the dynamics of calcium ions binding to CaM [@stefan2008Allostericd; @pepke2010Dynamic; @gonzalez-andrade2016Insights]. @linkevicius2025Fitting examined and compared various of these models, providing a useful summary of the typical categories for modeling CaM binding to $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. The model used here falls under their proposed "scheme 3" (@fig-scheme3-cam), where calcium binds and unbinds to four separate calcium binding sites in CaM. Unlike other models that distinguish between CaM's N-terminal and C-terminal binding lobes, this project does not, as the specifics of calcium binding to CaM are beyond its scope and following "scheme 3" approach to calcium binding produces biologically relevant results while avoiding complexity, allowing us to focus on further CaMKII and NMDARs interactions.

![We model calcium binding to CaM following "scheme 3" proposed by Linkevicius et al., 2024. It is a sequential CaM scheme where each binding site is represented individually.](30-methods-figures\scheme3_cam.PNG){#fig-scheme3-cam  fig-scap="Calcium binding to CaM" fig-pos='H' width="70%"}

### CaMKII subunits flicker between open and closed states {#sec-camkii-flicker}
It is well established that CaMKII subunits can exist in both open and closed conformations [@pullara2017Mechanisms; @zhang2017Opposing], even in the absence of CaM [@asciutto2021Physicalc].  While the notion that CaM induces a conformational change in CaMKII is the common view, the assumption that this binding event directly triggers subunit activation is largely based on the induced-fit model, as discussed in [@sec-cam-binding-and-t286-p]. These observations may be due to the fact that binding of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$/CaM to CaMKII is more likely when the CaMKII kinase subunits are in the open conformation.

CaMKII subunits inherently fluctuate between different conformational states (open and closed), and an alternative perspective is that CaM does not directly induce the opening of the subunit but rather stabilises the open conformation upon binding [@asciutto2021Physicalc]. This suggests that the enzyme does not strictly require CaM to transition into an open state; rather, CaM serves to stabilise and prolong this conformation, thereby sustaining enzymatic activity. From a dynamic standpoint, it is plausible that, in the absence of CaM, there exists a low probability of the subunit adopting an open conformation due to intrinsic structural fluctuations. Upon CaM binding, this equilibrium may shift, favouring the stabilisation of the open state and ultimately leading to the full activation observed in vitro [@asciutto2021Physicalc]. Accordingly, in this model, CaMKII subunits are considered to undergo spontaneous transitions between open and closed conformations (see #a in @fig-camkii-binding-rxns for schematic depiction), and the impact of CaM binding is assessed in terms of its stabilising effects on these states. 

CaM binding is not the only mechanism that can render CaMKII subunits in their open conformation. In the model used in this PhD, as per the known literature, CaMKII subunits can remain in an open conformation due to one or more of the following events:

- CaM binding: CaM binding has been shown to structurally stabilise the open conformation of the CaMKII kinase subunit, preventing the kinase domain from re-engaging with its own regulatory region, thereby maintaining the open state [@singla2001Molecular; @hoffman2011Conformational; @gaertner2004Comparative].
- T286 phosphorylation: Phosphorylation at this site occurs at the hinge region of CaMKII and prevents subunits from closing [@braun1995Multifunctional; @miller1986Regulation; @coultrap2010CaMKIIa; @buard2010CaMKII; @chang2017CaMKII]. This modification thus sustains the subunit in an open conformation, contributing to the prolonged activation of the kinase.
- NMDAR binding: Once a CaMKII subunit binds to the NMDA receptor, the interaction can stabilise the open state of the kinase. This CaMKII/NMDAR association has been shown to maintain the kinase in an active, open conformation, as discussed in @sec-CaMKII-NMDAR-association.

### Binding of CaM to CaMKII {#sec-binding-cam-camkii}
CaM bound to different amounts of calcium has been shown to bind to CaMKII with different affinities, with CaM bound to four calcium having the highest affinity [@linkevicius2025Fitting;@ordyan2020Interactions; @khan2024Realtimea].  While CaM binding to the low-affinity site is compatible with CaMKII remaining in a closed state, binding to the high-affinity site is thought to structurally prevent CaMKII from closing [@singla2001Molecular; @hoffman2011Conformational; @gaertner2004Comparative]. The literature suggestes that CaM binding in itself is not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of CaM is [@evans2009Energetics; @stefan2012Structural; @bossuyt2013Visualizing]. This is likely due to the stabilising effect of high affinity binding of CaM to CaMKII structurally keeping the kinase in its active state. 

In this model, for simplicity, we therefore assume that only fully saturated CaM with four calcium ions (CaM_Ca4) binds to open CaMKII subunits. Additionally, CaM binds to a CaMKII subunit only if T306 is dephosphorylated. The T305/T306 site lies within the CaM binding region. It has been shown that autophosphorylation at T305/T306 (T306 hereforth) impedes CaM binding, and similarly CaM binding prevents T306 phosphorylation [@rellos2010Structure]. In the model here, CaM is able to bind to CaMKII with the following rules:

- CaM must be fully saturated (bound to four calcium ions), i.e. only CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII. We assume only one high affinity binding site for CaM in each CaMKII subunit.
- CaMKII subunit must be in its open/active state.
- T306 must be unphosphorylated.

As described above in @sec-camkii-flicker when a CaMKII subunit spontaneously flickers into its active/open state CaM binding is likely to stabilize the subunit once it is already active, but does not initiate activation. Similarly, while it is commonly suggested that simultaneous binding of CaM to two neighboring subunits triggers T286 autophosphorylation, we propose that CaM's role might be more nuanced. Instead of being essential for T286 phosphorylation, CaM may stabilize the open state of CaMKII, thereby increasing the likelihood of phosphorylation. Therefore, in this model, we do not make it a requirement for CaM to be bound to neighbouring subunits for phosphorylation to happen. We consider CaM binding is not strictly necessary for autophosphorylation but rather enhances the probability of phosphorylation by maintaining subunits in their active/open state.

### CaMKII phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
The most studied phosphorylation sites on CaMKII are T286 and T305/T306. These sites are key for regulating CaMKII activity and subcellular localization at the PSD during LTP, which is of relevance for synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory [see @sec-cam-binding-and-t286-p and @sec-t305-p]. Likewise, in this study, we focus on these two sites. While other phosphorylation sites on CaMKII have been identified [@migues2006Phosphorylation; @gangopadhyay2008Regulation], their functions are not yet fully understood and are not within the scope of this study. 

### T286 phosphorylation 
I have modelled phosphorylation of T286 to occur with the condition that two adjascent CaMKII subunits are in their open states. Research shows that CaMKII subunits need to be open to expose the ATP binding site in the regulatory domain, allowing the gamma-phosphate of ATP to transfer to the threonine residue at T286 [@lou1986Activation; @hoffman2011Investigation]. The open (kinase domain available) and undocked (subunits can reach their neighbours) states of two neighbouring subunits is crucial for the catalytic site of one subunit to reach and phosphorylate its neighboring subunit. In our model, we assume ATP molecule levels are sufficient to ensure the reaction proceeds at its maximal rate (saturating), so we do not model ATP as a reactant but rather focus on the phosphorylation process under these conditions.

As discussed earlier, CaM bound to two neighbouring subunits is often referred to in the literature as being required for autophosphorylation and subsequent CaMKII activation [@nicoll2005Synaptic; @rellos2010Structureb]. CaM has been shown to keep CaMKII subunits in their open state, and therefore it may indirectly enhance probability of T286 phosphorylation. 

In the model I use here I don't make CaM a requirement for T286 phosphorylation, but rather once CaMKII is bound to CaM_Ca4, this binding keeps CaMKII subunits in their open state and further enables phosphorylation. The only requirement for CaMKII T286 phosphorylation is, therefore, that two adjacent subunits are in their open state to enable inter subunit phosphorylation at this site (as per @fig-docked-undocked previously described in @sec-biology-chapter and below in @fig-camkii-binding-rxns). 

### T306 phosphorylation
In contrast to T286 phosphorylation, T306 phosphorylation prevents binding of CaM, as the phosphate group added to the threonine creates electrostatic and steric interference, occupying the position where CaM normally interacts. In the model used here, CaM can therefore only bind to CaMKII if the T306 site is not phosphorylated, and conversely, phosphorylation at T306 cannot occur while CaM is bound (previously discussed in @sec-camkii-as-dodecamer). Similar to the conditions for T286, the model requires that a subunit must be in the open state for phosphorylation at T306 to take place. Since T286 phosphorylation maintains subunits in their open state, phosphorylation at T306 is more likely to occur if a neighboring subunit is phosphorylated at T286.

An aspect of phosphorylation at this site is that it does not prevent CaMKII subunits from closing, unlike T286 phosphorylation [@cook2021CaMKIIb]. This, together with the fact that it prevents CaM from binding, makes it more likely that subunits that are phosphorylated at T306 are found in the closed state too. When the subunit is closed, catalytic activity of the kinase is reduced, as the kinase domain is not accessible to perform catalytic activity. Therefore, this phosphorylation is ofen refered to as reducing catalytic activity of CaMKII. T306 phosphorylation may act as a form of kinetic proofreading, by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive, or less active, unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. Phosphorylation at T306 likely prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signalling in response to synaptic activity, which is discussed more in depth in [INSERT SECTION REFERENCE].

### Dephosphorylation of CaMKII subunits
There are multiple known phosphatases which act to dephosphorylate CaMKII in the PSD [REFERENCES]. Different dephosphatase proteins will carry their function depending on their localization and what protein assemblies they are bound to or are available for them. Importantly, the Ser/Thr phosphatase Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a key regulator of CaMKII signalling [REFERENCES]; and it can dephosphorylate both T286 and T306 sites of the kinase. 

The colocalization with PSD-associated PP1 or sequestration away from PP2A may be attributable to CaMKII interactions with specific PSD proteins, resulting in differential modulation of Thr286 dephosphorylation. PP1 can form a complex with over 50 regulatory or scaffolding proteins that dictate substrate specificity and subcellular localization. There are four known PP1 subunit isoforms of the catalytic subunit (α, β, γ1, and γ2), each interacting with over 40 known regulatory and/or target subunits. PP1α has been shown to account for the majority of phosphatase actvity with CaMKII in the PSD [REFERENCE]. Therefore, we focus on PP1α in this study. 

In the model used here, PP1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of CaMKII without forming a stable enzyme-substrate complex. Instead, the reaction proceeds in a manner where PP1 transiently interacts, without binding, with a CaMKII subunit under specific conditions, facilitating the dephosphorylation process. PP1 can only dephosphorylate CaMKII subunits when they are unbound from CaM, as CaM structurally obstructs access to the T286 phosphorylation site. Additionally, the CaMKII subunit must be in its open conformation to expose both the T286 and T306 sites for PP1-mediated dephosphorylation. 

### CaMKII and NMDAR binding 

clarify we say nmdar but we are referring to dynamics specifically with gln2b, also summary fo below is that we dont know how camkii exaclty binds to nmdar, but what we do know is that it binds, and enzymatic activity is kept, but doesnt seem to be the imporatn factor at play, instead the binding of this complex is leading towards structural functions that will bediscussed in DISCUSSION-SECTION. 

As presented in [INTRO-BIO-CHAPTER], research seems to point to CaMKII and NMDARs interaction in the PSD to be a key mediator of LTP. So much so that in fact it has recently been suggested that CaMKII and NMDAR binding may be a minimal requirement for LTP in dendritic spines. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction remains debated. 

One proposed mechanism is that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of NMDAR, which shares homology with CaMKII's regulatory segment, binds to the kinase domain, potentially displacing the regulatory region. A long-standing hypothesis to explain how the CTD maintains CaMKII in its active state suggests that one end of the GluN2B CTD wedges at the T-site of CaMKII, preventing autoinhibition, while the other end remains loosely bound to the kinase's active site (or S site). Recent crystal structure studies, however, challenge this two-site model, revealing that substrates like GluN2B bind to a single continuous site across the kinase domain. This interaction involves a salt bridge that enhances CaMKII's affinity for activator peptides and sustains its active conformation. @ozden2022CaMKIIb propose that GluN2B binding triggers a conformational change that rotates the αD helix in the kinase domain outward, stabilizing the enzyme in its active state and preventing re-association of the regulatory segment, thereby maintaining CaMKII's catalytic activity.

In the midst of this uncertainty, it is well-established that CaMKII binds to the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, a critical interaction that stabilizes CaMKII in its open, active conformation. In this model, CaMKII is capable of associating with an NMDAR, provided CaMKII is in its open conformation and that the receptor has a free CaMKII binding site (see reaction rule number 12 in TABLE-REFERENCE). Once bound, the CaMKII/NMDAR complex is formed, maintaining the kinase in its active state by stabilizing its open conformation. 


In the GluN2B-bound state,
the enzyme becomes resistant to the action of phosphatases
(Cheriyan et al., 2011) indicating GluN2B-induced structural
changes which can be abolished by specific mutations in CaMKII (Mayadevi et al., 2016). file:///C:/Users/susan/Downloads/fnmol-15-855752.pdf
