## LTP as an attractive model to explain memory and learning
The cellular changes that underline different forms of memory are thought to involve changes in the strength of neuronal connections. Over a century ago, @ramonycajal1909HistologieSystemeNerveux proposed that the nervous system is composed of microscopic, independent cells —neurons— that form intricate networks of connections. The notion that synaptic strength changes during learning and memory was refined into a concrete model by @hebb1949OrganizationBehaviorNeuropsychological. Hebb proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time, the synapses between them are strengthened. The first mechanism supporting synaptic strengthening, long-term potentiation (LTP), was then discovered in the late 1960s using rabbits' hippocampus _in vitro_ [LOMO Gardner-Medwin REFERENCE]. This discovery of LTP showed that short, high frequency stimulation (tetanus) of hippocampal excitatory synapses produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the strength of these synapses that could persist for many days [@bliss1973Longlasting]. Later on, in 1986, Morris et al. water maze experiment provided early evidence suggesting that the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is essential for at least some forms of LTP associated with learning and memory [@morris1986Selective]. In the years since, there have been many more experiments conducted on rodents, often using fear conditioning or subjecting them to brain injuries, that provide further evidence of LTP's role in different types of memory and learning [@lynch2004LongTerm; @dringenberg2020History; @vorhees2024Tests; @park2024Fear].

To this day, LTP remains a compelling model for explaining memory at the cellular and molecular level. Its key properties, such as associativity, cooperativity, input-specificity [@fig-ltp-properties] and persistence [@fig-ltp-persistence], make it an ideal candidate for understanding the mechanisms underlying learning and memory [baltaci2019Molecular] [REFERENCES]. The associativity principle indicates that simultaneous activity at a stronger synaptic connection enables LTP at an associatively linked weaker synapse [REFERENCE]. Cooperativity involves the strengthening of synapses when multiple neurons are activated together, suggesting that a cooperative input can enhance synaptic strength more effectively. Input-specificity stipulates that LTP occurs only in the synaptic pathway that received the tetanic stimulation, whilst inactive synapses that contact the same neuron will not share synaptic enhancement (REFERENCE: Andersen et al., 1977; Lynch et al., 1977). In regards to persistence, LTP has been shown to last for several hours in _in vitro_ slice preparations and for many months in freely moving animals (in vivo; Abraham, 2003), suggesting a capacity for sustained physiological changes that aligns well with memory formation. Together, these characteristics set conditional requirements that are likely to allow selective strengthening of specific synaptic connections thought to be involved in memory storage.

![(A) Bliss and Lomo’s experiment [reference] demonstrated LTP in the hippocampus by stimulating the perforant pathway in an anesthetized rabbit.A stimulating electrode was placed in the axons of the perforant pathway at the hippocampal entry, while a recording electrode was positioned in the dentate gyrus, where neurotransmitter release occurs. They recorded field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and observed that high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz for 3 seconds) of the Schaffer collaterals (SC) enhanced fEPSP amplitude in the CA1 region, indicating LTP was a measurable phenomenon. (B) The potentiation can persist for many minutes after tetanus; in other experiments (not shown) potentiation persisted for up to one year, suggesting long-lasting synaptic changes [REFERENCE].](20-biology_figures\ltp_persistence.PNG){#fig-ltp-persistence}

(B) Specificity is evidenced by the fact that strong stimulus induces LTP in synapses that are active, but not in neighboring synapses that remain inactive. (C) Associativity refers to the phenomenon where a weak stimulus alone does not induce LTP, but when paired with a concurrent strong stimulus, it leads to LTP and strengthens both pathways. ](20-biology_figures\ltp_properties.PNG){#fig-ltp-properties}

These properties have been extensively observed [REFERENCES], yet the precise molecular mechanisms underlying LTP remains a topic of ongoing investigation. Since its discovery, different forms of LTP have been observed across various regions of the brain in both humans and non-human animals [@chen1996Longterm; @beck2000Synaptic; @nicoll2017BriefHistoryLongTerm; @spriggs2019Human]. Moreover, the different forms of LTP further depend on a number of factors such as developmental stage, pre- or post-synaptic stimulation as well as stimulation protocols. Two main types of LTP have been described as being either NMDA receptor-dependent or NMDA receptor-independent [@collingridge1983Excitatory; @harris1984Longterm; @morris1986Selective; @grover1990Two; @grover1992Nmethyldaspartate; @zi1993Induction; @bortolotto1993Characterisation; @bortolotto1999Roles; @cavus1996Two; @grover1998Evidence; @nicoll2005SynapticPlasticityHippocampal; @aou2003Orexinhypocretin1; @rebola2008Adenosine; @erondu1985RegionalDistributionType; @kumar2011LongTerm]. This project will focus on studying the NMDA receptor-dependent form of LTP at synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To avoid ambiguities, this is the type of LTP discussed unless otherwise stated. 

### NMDAR-dependent LTP: signalling and phases {#sec-LTP-phases}
LTP is typically divided into distinct phases: induction, expression, and maintenance. _Induction_ refers to the transient events that initiate the formation of LTP. _Maintenance_ refers to a persisting biochemical signal that lasts in neurons. This lasting biochemical signal influences an effector, such as a glutamate receptor like NMDARs, leading to the _expression_ of LTP [@sweatt2010Chaptera]. To provide a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LTP, key molecular interactions associated with these phases are described next.

During the induction phase, NMDA receptors play a critical role as coincidence detectors. These receptors are non-selective cationic, glutamate receptors characterised by a voltage-dependent magnesium (Mg²⁺) block, which prevents ion flow under resting conditions. Upon tetanic stimulation of presynaptic fibers, neurotransmitters, primarily glutamate, are released onto the postsynaptic membrane. This glutamate can bind to NMDARs as a ligand, however, this is is typically not sufficient to open the channel and let ions through due to the Mg2+ voltage block. Glutamate can also bind to α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors located in the postsynaptic neuron, which can trigger an influx of positively charged sodium ions into the postsynaptic cell, and lead to cell depolarization. If the degree of depolarization is sufficient to remove the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor pore, then the channel will allow influx of Ca2+ into the cell. As a result, NMDA receptors act as molecular coincidence detectors, allowing ion flux only when these conditions are met. This is a critical aspect of NMDA receptor regulation, enabling the receptor to play a unique role in molecular-level information processing.

The influx of calcium ions leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations within the PSD of dendritic spines, which are specialized protrusions on neurons that serve as the primary sites for excitatory synaptic transmission. Following the entry of calcium, the ions can bind to calmodulin (CaM) to form a Ca2+/CaM complex that is recognized by multiple enzymes. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is one of the primary targets of the Ca²⁺/CaM complex, and the star kinase of this PhD project.

In the expression phase, the strengthening of synaptic transmission occurs mostly through post-synaptic modifications. CaMKII phosphorylates AMPA receptors, increasing their ion conductance, and promotes the trafficking of additional AMPA receptors to the synaptic membrane, thereby enhancing the response to glutamate. While primarily a postsynaptic phenomenon, retrograde messengers such as nitric oxide (NO) may also be released to influence presynaptic function, increasing neurotransmitter release and further strengthening the synapse.

The maintenance phase involves structural and molecular changes that stabilise the enhanced synaptic strength over time. Structural modifications, such as the enlargement of dendritic spines and cytoskeletal rearrangement mediated by actin polymerisation, support the long-term persistence of LTP. Protein synthesis, regulated by transcription factors like CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), also facilitates the production of proteins necessary for synaptic stabilisation. Additionally, scaffolding proteins, such as PSD-95, anchor AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic density, ensuring their sustained incorporation into the synaptic membrane. These changes collectively enable the persistence of LTP, making it a robust mechanism for memory storage at the cellular level.

Additionally, LTP is often further categorised into early-phase LTP (E-LTP) and late-phase LTP (L-LTP), although an initial/short term potentiation and an intermediate phase of LTP have also been suggested [@huang1998Synaptic; @winder1998Genetic; @lisman2005Phases; @kumar2011LongTerm]. E-LTP occurs shortly after high-frequency stimulation of a synapse, and is typically characterized by a rapid increase in synaptic strength that lasts for a few minutes to hours. It relies primarily on the activation of NMDA receptors and the influx of calcium ions [@malenka1992Temporal; @frey1997Synaptic; @bliss2003How; @bliss2018Longterm]. L-LTP, on the other hand, is the prolonged phase of synaptic enhancement that can last for days or even weeks [@jackson1993Stereotypical; @harris1984Developmental; @muller1989Developmental; @bekenstein1991Vivo; @figurov1996Regulation; @mohns2008Synchronous]. L-LTP is dependent on new protein synthesis and gene expression. This phase is critical for the consolidation of memory and is associated with structural changes in the synapse, including the growth of dendritic spines and the synthesis of new receptors [@bliss2018Longterm].

The categorisation of LTP into distinct phases is not rigidly defined as strictly sequential; rather, the phases serve as distinct categories to help us talk about the different stages of LTP. Induction, expression, and maintenance can apply to both E-LTP and L-LTP; with E-LTP and L-LTP phases being _induced_ and _expressed_ in diverse ways (for example, through protein synthesis) [@pfeiffer2006Current; @abraham2008LTP] and _maintained_ for differing durations (for seconds, hours or longer) [@abraham2003Properties]. Additionally, E-LTP and L-LTP are not mutually exclusive. In fact, depending on the specific LTP induction protocol applied, E-LTP can happen concurrently with the development of L-LTP, with one gradually replacing the other over time [@roberson1996Biochemists; @bliss1993Synaptic; @kandel2001Molecular; @nicoll2003Expression; @malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @luscher2012NMDA]. This PhD research investigates the specific molecular interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs, primarily focusing on their roles in E-LTP induction and maintenance. 

## Why focus on CaMKII and NMDARs interactions to study LTP?
To answer this question, it is crucial to first explore the structure and properties of these proteins in order to understand how their specific characteristics enable them to play vital roles in mediating LTP. As we have seen, NMDA receptors' ability to act as a coincidence detector underpins hallmark features of LTP. For instance, cooperativity and associativity arise because multiple synapses must be activated together to generate sufficient postsynaptic depolarization, which is gatekept through the magnesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity can occur due to the localized increase in calcium concentration, which is confined to the postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not affect adjacent spines, thus ensuring that only the activated synapses undergo potentiation (Nicoll et al., 1988) [REFERENCES]. Notably, the calcium permeability of NMDARs is also crucial for triggering a cascade of reactions that ultimately involves CaMKII, a key mediator of LTP, as discussed below.

By definition, NMDAR-dependent LTP requires the synaptic activation of NMDARs during postsynaptic depolarization. NMDARs are therefore essential mediators for the induction of this type of LTP. Indeed, inhibition of these receptors in various regions of the hippocampus have been shown to prevent LTP induction, as well as lead to impairments in learning and memory in rodents (Collingridge et al., 1983; Morris et al., 1986). Likewise, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout of NMDARs have been shown to block LTP induction in rodent hippocampal circuits [REFERENCES]. 

It is helpful to distinguish here between molecules that act as mediators versus modulators during LTP. Mediators are key components of the molecular machinery directly responsible for LTP, they are essential and necessary. In contrast, modulators may influence the conditions under which LTP can occur, for example they may regulate the threshold for LTP induction or enhance its expression under certain conditions, but are not necessarily essential for LTP's occurrence. Although the line between these roles can sometimes be blurred, understanding this difference can be helpful for elucidating what are the minimal requirements for LTP and identifying additional factors that contribute to its modulation and enhancement.

A key molecule with substantial evidence supporting its role as an essential mediator of LTP is the protein of interest in this PhD: CaMKII [REFERENCES]. We have briefly mentioned some of CaMKIIs functions across the distinct phases of long-term potentiation (LTP) (see @#sec-LTP-phases). Let us now delve deeper into the reasons why CaMKII is considered a pivotal molecule for the mechanisms underlying LTP. Firstly, there is evidence demonstrating that LTP induction is inhibited in knockout mice lacking CaMKII (Silva et al, 1992). Similarly, knock-in mice in which endogenous CaMKII was replaced with a mutant lacking CaMKII's autophosphorylation site also failed to exhibit LTP (Giese et al., 1998). Conversely, artificially increasing active CaMKII levels in postsynaptic cells enhanced synaptic strength and increased LTP expression [REFERENCES]. 

### CaMKII biophysical properties {.unnumbered}

CaMKII is expressed ubiquitously in animals, with four known isoforms $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ [REFERENCES]. This study focuses on the brain specific $\alpha$ isoform, which constitutes up to 2% of total brain protein. $\alpha$-CaMKII is one of the main proteins in the PSD, and has extensively been shown to be important for LTP and memory formation [REFERENCES]. Unless otherwise stated, references to CaMKII throughout this project will specifically pertain to $\alpha$-CaMKII. This kinase is a large holoenzyme consisting of 10/12 subunits [REFERENCES]. Each of the subunits has a catalytic/kinase domain, followed by a regulatory domain that contains a self-inhibitory region and a binding site for the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) complex [@fig-camkii-domains].

(D) kinase domain (this figure legend needs updating).
:::

CaMKII subunits can be found docked (also known as "compact state"), or undocked (or extended); and open, or closed (@fig-camkii-structure). The docked/undocked states describe the compact or extended structure configurations of the CaMKII holoenzyme subunits, where the kinase domains are packed close to the central hub or not. The closed/open states refer to the conformational changes in the kinase and regulatory domains; these domains can adopt an "open" state, allowing interactions or activity, or a "closed" state, in which they are bound together, reducing its kinase activity. 

In other words, in the docked state, CaMKII subunits adopt a more compact configuration, where the regulatory domain is closely associated with the hub domain. When CaMKII subunits are found in the docked state, they cannot autophosphorylate their neighbouring subunits, even if the subunits are open. This is because the compact shape does not allow the kinase domain of one subunit to structurally reach its neighbour. Therefore, it is thought that for CaMKII to have autphosphorylation activity, subunits need to be in an “open” and undocked conformation [REFERENCE]. Subunits in a docked, open state may bind to and perform some kinase activity [REFERENCE NEEDED], but they lack the structural capacity for autophosphorylation activity. In the undocked state, the regulatory domain is extended and separated from the hub domain. This conformation makes the subunits less compact and more “loose” which can facilitate interactions within subunits, and with other substrates. When undocked, CaMKII subunits can phosphorylate neighbours so long as they are in an open state as the kinase domain is structurally available to perform such function. If a subunit is undocked but closed, it lacks catalytic activity because its regulatory domain is bound to its catalytic site, preventing the kinase domain from being accessed or accessing targets. 

When CaMKII is in its closed conformation, structural constraints prevent calmodulin (CaM) from interacting with the kinase. In contrast, in the open conformation, CaMKII subunits can autophosphorylate each other at threonine 286 (T286) found in the regulatory segment, which prevents the segment from closing, and uncovers the binding sites in the kinase domain for CaMKIIs substrates and anchoring proteins. Importantly, in their open conformation, the calmodulin binding site in the regulatory segment of the CaMKII subunits becomes available for interaction. Calmodulin binding is thought to stabilise the kinase subunits in their open conformation, facilitating further autophosphorylation among neighbouring subunits. What is more, binding of Ca2+/CaM has been shown to significantly increase the kinase's affinity for Ca2+/CaM itself, creating a feedforward loop. This means that as more Ca²⁺/CaM binds, it makes it easier for additional Ca²⁺/CaM to bind, which promotes further autophosphorylation and stabilisation of the kinase in its open conformation. 

CaMKII's increased autophosphorylation capability allows it to remain active in an autonomous manner, indepedent of calcium/calmodulin binding, even after the initial calcium signal has faded. This autonomous activation is crucial for memory formation and synaptic modification, as it allows CaMKII to sustain long-term changes in cellular activity, ensuring that modifications are maintained over time.

The increased autophosphorylation capability of CaMKII enables it to remain active in an autonomous manner, indepedent of calcium/calmodulin binding, even after the initial calcium signal has faded. This autonomous behavior of CaMKII is key for its role in memory formation and synaptic modification, as  autophosphorylation of CaMKII helps sustain these changes after the initial calcium signal fades, ensuring that the modification is long-lasting.

This increased autophosphorylation capability is thought to enable CaMKII to remain in an autonomous, autophoshorylated form that is indepedent of calcium/calmodulin-independent once the initial signal of calcoum has faded., which enables enzymatic activity to persist even after the initial calcium stimulus has passed [REFERENCES]. What is more, binding of CaM has been shown to significantly increase the kinase's affinity for calcium-bound CaM.[REFERENCE].

When CaMKII si clsoed, the structural constraints of CaMKII prevent CaM from interacting with the kinase. However, in the open conformation, T286 autophosphorylation, the autoinhibitory segment may be kept in its open state allowing more CaM to bind to the kinase. In this way, autoP allows for autonomous activity without cam AND for more CaM to bind and induce even more autoP in a sort of feedforward loop. 

_"Moreover, binding of CaM significantly enhances the kinase's affinity for calcium-bound CaM. In its basal state, the structural constraints of CaMKII prevent CaM from interacting with the kinase. However, after autophosphorylation at T286, the autoinhibitory segment is held in an open conformation, facilitating greater CaM binding to the kinase. This increased CaM binding not only sustains the autonomous activity of CaMKII without the need for calcium or calmodulin, but also promotes further autophosphorylation in a positive feedback loop. As a result, CaMKII activity becomes self-reinforcing, leading to sustained kinase activation even in the absence of the initial calcium signal."_

Two additional autophosphorylation sites, T305 and T306, provide CaMKII with important autoregulatory functions, although the exact mechanisms behind this remain uncovered. These sites are within the CaM binding segment; if they are phosphorylated CaM cannot bind, and if CaM is bound these sites cannot phosphorylate. These sites' activity is often referred to as ihibutory autophosphorylation, as its prevention from CaM binding consequentially leads to reduced catalytic activity of CaMKII

 This subunit phosphorylation is ofen refered to as reducing catalytic activity of CaMKII. T306 phosphorylation may act as a form of kinetic proofreading, by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive, or less active, unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. It prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling in response to synaptic activity.

In fact, one of the most popular theories for memory in molecular neuroscience has been that LTP induction (and potentially maintenance) requires enzymatic activity of CaMKII [REFERENCES]. The enzymatic action of CaMKII has two types of targets, first, itself, as autophosphorylation maintains the enzyme in the open, active, and autonomous, conformation. Secondly, CaMKIIs enzymatic action also targets the phosphorylation of various downstream target proteins, such as the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, or the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, among others [REFERENCE]. 

The T286 autophosphorylation mechanism of CaMKII has long been proposed as a critical requirement for LTP induction. Interestingly, studies using pharmacological and optogenetic inhibitors of CaMKII have demonstrated that blocking CaMKII activity before LTP induction abolishes LTP, but inhibiting CaMKII after LTP induction does not reverse LTP, which is inconsistent with the autonomous CaMKII hypothesis of biochemical memory storage _(Buard et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2001; Malinow et al., 1989; Murakoshi et al., 2017; Otmakhov et al., 1997; Sanhueza et al., 2011), but also see (Sanhueza et al., 2007).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5573161/._ The relative significance of CaMKIIs T286 autophosphorylation, phosphorylation and binding of downstream target proteins, continues to be a subject of intense debate [REFERENCES]. Much of the uncertainty in interpreting studies that inhibit CaMKII enzymatic activity and its exact role in LTP arises from the fact that such inhibition also disrupts CaMKII's structural functions, particularly its binding to the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors.

By definition, NMDAR-dependent LTP requires synaptic activation of NMDARs during postsynaptic depolarization. NMDARs are essential mediators for the generation of LTP, where inhibition of NMDARs in various regions of the hippocampus prevents this type of LTP induction as well as further memory and learning impairments [REFERENCES]. Likewise, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout of NMDARs impair LTP induction in the hippocampus of rodents. Interestingly, NMDARs role as a mediator for further LTP expression and maintenance remains to be ellucidated as research provides different views on this; part of the reason why this is hard to ellucidate may be due to the compensating mechanisms where LTP can actually proceed through different pathways. 


Moreover, there is extensive research demonstrating that the inhibition of NMDARs in various regions of the hippocampus prevents LTP induction as well as further memory and learning impairments [REFERENCES]. Likewise, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout of NMDARs impair LTP induction in the hippocampus of rodents. Indeed, evidence suggests that NMDARs are key mediators for LTP induction, their presence and activity is necessary for inducing LTP. 



 blocking the activation of NMDAR uring LTP induction blocks LTP; and activation of NMDARs also induces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which occludes further synaptic induction of LTP.


that provides evidence for the fact that inhibiting NMDARs in different areas of the hippocampus leads to abolition of LTP [REFERENCES]. And although we know that NMDAR function is essential for LTP formation, the exact mechanisms remain elusive. NMDARs interact with various proteins in the PSD, and ellucidating what molecules are key components of the molecular machinery directly responsible for the triggering of LTP (‘mediators’), versus what molecules which may modulate the ability to generate LTP, or play a permissive role (‘modulators’) can be obtused.

 Some basic criteria that can be suggested for defining the role of a protein as a mediator of LTP induction are: (1) blocking the activation of the molecule during LTP induction blocks LTP; and (2) activation of the molecule induces a potentiation of synaptic transmission, which occludes further synaptic induction of LTP.

act as coincidence detectors meaning they are activated only when two conditions are met simultaneously: presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic depolarization. Indeed, this coincidence detector properties of NMDARs also help explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and associativity occur because of the requirement for multiple synapses to be activated simultaneously to generate adequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the magnesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the compartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to the postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence adjacent spines (Nicoll et al, 1988).
