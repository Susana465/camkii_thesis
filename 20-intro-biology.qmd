# Biological Research Background{#sec-biology-chapter}
This introductory chapter outlines the biological research questions explored in this PhD. It begins by defining key concepts, including learning and synaptic plasticity, and highlights the relevance of long-term potentiation (LTP) as a model for studying these processes at the cellular level. The chapter then delves into the roles of the primary molecules of interest—N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) — and their critical involvement in the mechanisms underlying LTP. Finally, the chapter sets out the biological research aims of this PhD, providing the foundation for investigating these molecular pathways to advance our understanding of synaptic plasticity and memory.

## Learning, memory and synaptic plasticity {#sec-learning-memory-plasticity}
Learning and memory, whether declarative (referring to the conscious recollection of events) or non-declarative (which underpins changes in skilled behaviour and its improvement through practice) has been a topic of interest and intrigue for centuries. The question of how the brain learns and stores information remains central to our understanding of cognition. It is widely recognised that information is encoded in patterns of synaptic connections within neuronal networks, and that changes in these connections, known as synaptic plasticity, are fundamental to learning and memory. Current understanding suggests that the cellular changes underlying different forms of memory involve modifications in the strength of neuronal connections [@shapiro1999Hippocampus; @lamprecht2004Structural; @takeuchi2014Synaptic;  @abraham2019Plasticity].

Over a century ago, @ramonycajal1909HistologieSystemeNerveux proposed that the nervous system is composed of microscopic, independent neurons that form intricate networks of connections. The notion that synaptic strength changes during learning and memory was refined into a concrete model by @hebb1949OrganizationBehaviorNeuropsychological. Hebb proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time, the synapses between them are strengthened. The first mechanism supporting synaptic strengthening, long-term potentiation (LTP), was then discovered in the late 1960s using rabbits' hippocampus _in vitro_ [@lomo1971PatternsActivationMonosynaptic] (@fig-ltp-persistence). This discovery of LTP showed that short, high frequency stimulation (tetanus) of hippocampal excitatory synapses produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the strength of these synapses that could persist for several hours; and later experiments showed peristance of up to 3 days [@bliss1973Longlasting]. 

![(A) Bliss and Lomo’s experiment [@bliss1973Longlastinga] demonstrated LTP in the hippocampus by stimulating the perforant pathway in an anesthetized rabbit. The experimental setup involved placing a stimulating electrode in the axons of the perforant pathway at the hippocampal entry, while a recording electrode was positioned in the CA1 region. Axonal projections from the entorhinal cortex innervate granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) via the perforant pathway. These granule cells, in turn, send their axonal projections to pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region. The CA3 neurons then excite pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region through the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway (SCC), forming a critical neural circuit for hippocampal information processing. (B) The results showed that the high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of SCCs led to a lasting increase in fEPSP amplitude, further supporting the concept of LTP as a measurable and significant phenomenon (left). The results revealed that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the SCC led to a persistent increase in the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), providing further evidence for LTP as a measurable and significant phenomenon (left panel). The right panel shows LTD induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Synaptic strength is quantified as the initial slope of the fEPSP (normalised to baseline), and this is plotted over time.

In 1986, Morris et al. provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories _in vivo_ using rats [@morris1986Selective]. These rats were trained in the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which the rodents swam in a pool of murky water until they located a platform hidden beneath the surface. During this exercise, the rats had no other choice but to learn the location of the hidden platform through salient cues placed at specific positions around the maze's circumference. After the rats had memorised where the cues and platforms were, one group was subjected to having their hippocampi bathed in a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, while another group to whom nothing was done, served as the control. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool. However, the rats that had been subjected to the blocker treatment had significantly impaired memory. Moreover, when both groups were killed and slices of their hippocampal slices were analyzed, LTP was readily induced in the control group, while it could not be induced in the brains of the rats subjected to the NMDAR blocker. This experiment using rats provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor (and LTP) was important for at least some types of learning and memory. In the years since, there have been many more experiments conducted on rodents, often using fear conditioning or subjecting them to brain injuries, that provide further evidence of LTP's role in different types of memory and learning [@lynch2004LongTerm; @dringenberg2020History; @vorhees2024Tests; @park2024Fear].

It is important to note here that LTP does not equal memory, though they are linked. LTP refers to long-lasting enhancement in synaptic strength and signal transmission between neurons. As we have just seen, it is considered a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory, primarily observed in brain regions like the hippocampus, where synaptic activity is persistently amplified in response to high-frequency stimulation. Memory, on the other hand, is a higher level process by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain. Memory underpins cognitive functions and allows for the recall of past events, facts, and procedures [@abraham2019Plasticity]; nevertheless, as we will discuss next, synaptic strengthening and weakening provide compelling characteristics that make LTP a prime candidate to study molecular mechanisms underpinning memory formation. 

## Studying synaptic plasticity at the hippocampus
The hippocampus has long been considered a key model for studying synaptic plasticity due to its central role in learning and memory [@bliss1993Synaptic; @morris2006Elements]. Much of this knowledge has come from research done using rodents, often involving experiment that induce stress or fear conditioning, and/or introduce genetic mutations designed to impair the rodents behaviour (see the following some non-exhaustive examples: [@foy1987Behavioral; @kim2002Stressed; @zemla2017Hippocampal; @knierim2015Hippocampus; @park2018Role]). This brain region is particularly important in processes such as spatial memory, episodic memory, and the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory [@moscovitch2016Episodic; @postle2016Chapter]. Its structure, which includes well-defined neural circuits and easily identifiable synapses, makes it an ideal system for investigating how synaptic connections change. In particular, the CA1-CA3 regions have been extensively studied due to their involvement in these memory processes [@lisman1999Relating; @bliss1993Synaptic; @hunsaker2008Evaluating; @cutsuridis2010Encoding; @rebola2017Operation].

In addition to LTP, the hippocampus also exhibits long-term depression (LTD), a complementary mechanism in which synaptic strength is reduced (@fig-ltp-persistence) [@malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @abraham2024Longterm]. LTD is typically induced by low-frequency stimulation of afferent inputs, leading to a decrease in synaptic efficacy. This weakening of synapses is essential for synaptic homeostasis, preventing excessive strengthening of connections and allowing for the encoding of new information [@luscher2012NMDA; @nabavi2014Engineering]. Together, LTP and LTD are thought to form the basis of bidirectional synaptic plasticity, enabling the hippocampus to modulate and refine its neural circuits to optimise memory storage and retrieval. The focus of this thesis is on LTP to further understand learning and memory at the cellular and molecular level.

## LTP as an attractive model to explain memory and learning{#sec-LTP-to-explain-memory}
To this day, LTP remains a compelling model for explaining memory at the cellular and molecular level. Its key properties, such as associativity, cooperativity, input-specificity (@fig-ltp-properties) and persistence (@fig-ltp-persistence), make it an ideal candidate for understanding the mechanisms underlying learning and memory [@shors1997Longterm; @tsien2012Chapter; @baltaci2019Molecular]. The associativity principle indicates that simultaneous activity at a stronger synaptic connection enables LTP at an associatively linked weaker synapse. Cooperativity involves the strengthening of synapses when multiple neurons are activated together, suggesting that a cooperative input can enhance synaptic strength more effectively. Cooperativity and associativity of synaptic activity reflect the idea that multiple simultaneous inputs enhance learning, much like how repeated exposures or multi-sensory experiences improve memory formation [@dringenberg2020Historya]. Input-specificity stipulates that LTP occurs only in the synaptic pathway that received the tetanic stimulation, whilst inactive synapses that contact the same neuron will not share synaptic enhancement [@sumner2020Role; @jillgrose-fifer202495]. In regards to persistence, LTP has been shown to last for several hours in _in vitro_ slice preparations and for many months in freely moving animals [@bliss2003How], suggesting a capacity for sustained physiological changes that aligns well with memory formation. Together, these characteristics set conditional requirements that are likely to allow selective strengthening of specific synaptic connections thought to be involved in memory storage.

![LTP properties of cooperativity, specificity and associativity. (A) Cooperativity refers to the requirement of a sufficient number of presynaptic fibers to be activated in order to induce LTP. (B) Specificity is evidenced by the fact that strong stimulus induces LTP in synapses that are active, but not in neighboring synapses that remain inactive. (C) Associativity refers to the phenomenon where a weak stimulus alone does not induce LTP, but when paired with a concurrent strong stimulus, it leads to LTP and strengthens both pathways. ](20-biology_figures\ltp_properties.PNG){#fig-ltp-properties}

There are several experimental strategies that are widely used to explore the relationship between LTP and learning and memory. One widely used approach involves behavioural pharmacological studies, in which the effects of drugs that inhibit LTP induction are assessed in parallel with their impact on learning and memory performance [@dringenberg2020History; @najenson2024LTP]. These studies often reveal that pharmacological blockade of key molecular pathways necessary for LTP, such as NMDAR activity or kinase signalling, is associated with deficits in learning tasks. A well-known example is the pharmacological inhibition of NMDARs in rats using the Morris Water Maze (see example description in @sec-learning-memory-plasticity), where NMDAR antagonists reduce LTP and impair the acquisition of spatial information, correlating NMDARs and LTP impairment with deficits in spatial memory. 

Another strategy involves the use of genetic manipulations, particularly gene deletion (knockout) or transgenic mice. For example, knockout mice lacking $\alpha$-CaMKII, the predominant isoform in the hippocampus, exhibit a complete loss of LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses [@stevens1994Role; @incontro2018CaMKII]. These mice also show severe deficits in spatial learning. These examples illustrate that when LTP is impaired, memory performance is also often disrupted, supporting a correlation between the two. They also highlight the ethical implications of such invasive experiments, which would not be morally unacceptable if conducted in humans in our current day and age, yet we talk about these experiments as if they were normal routine to explain molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. 

The proposal of LTP as a leading model to explain learning and memory, however, has not been one without significant challenges. Interestingly, different studies have shown that when rats undergo nonspatial pretraining (a technique designed to teach the rats the behavioural strategies necessary for successfully completing the maze, without having the rat learn a specific spatial location of the platform) before application of an NMDAR blocker, they exhibit intact spatial learning despite complete LTP blockade [@bannerman1995Distinct;@saucier1995Spatial]. This suggests that hippocampal LTP is not strictly _necessary_ for spatial memory acquisition, and shows that there are other mechanisms apart from LTP through which learning and memory can;@moser2000Pretraining proceed. What is more, depending on what specific function of CaMKII is inhibited, different phases of LTP are hindered. For example, using peptide inhibitors that block CaMKII's enzymatic activity can reverse LTP if done shortly after induction, whereas applying the same inhibitors 15 minutes later has no effects on LTP. Suggesting that CaMKII’s enzymatic activity is important during the early post-induction phase but not for later maintenance of LTP [@rumian2024LTP; @bayer2024Revised].

These examples highlight the complexity of these processes and start to shed light as to why their exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In fact, it is worth noting that LTP is not the sole mechanism contributing to memory storage. Alternative mechanisms, including long-term depression (LTD), structural plasticity, neurogenesis, changes in neuronal excitability, and specialized neuronal assemblies (for example engram cells), likely interact with or compensate for LTP during learning and memory [@luscher2012NMDAc; @cameron2015Adult; @lisman2017Glutamatergic; @luis2022Understanding]. Nonetheless, whilst LTP is not the only mechanism underlying learning and memory, it still provides a valuable model for understanding the cellular and molecular processes involved.

Adding further complexity to the relationship between LTP and memory, since its discovery, different forms of LTP have been observed across various regions of the brain in both humans and non-human animals [@chen1996Longterm; @beck2000Synaptic; @nicoll2017BriefHistoryLongTerm; @spriggs2019Human]. Moreover, the different forms of LTP further depend on a number of factors such as developmental stage, pre- or post-synaptic stimulation as well as stimulation protocols. Two main types of LTP have been described as being either NMDA receptor-dependent or NMDA receptor-independent [@collingridge1983Excitatory; @harris1984Longterm; @morris1986Selective; @grover1990Two; @grover1992Nmethyldaspartate; @zi1993Induction; @bortolotto1993Characterisation; @bortolotto1999Roles; @cavus1996Two; @grover1998Evidence; @nicoll2005SynapticPlasticityHippocampal; @aou2003Orexinhypocretin1; @rebola2008Adenosine; @erondu1985RegionalDistributionType; @kumar2011LongTerm]. This project will focus on studying the NMDA receptor-dependent form of LTP at synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To avoid ambiguities, this is the type of LTP discussed unless otherwise stated. 

### Key features of NMDAR-dependent LTP

To further understand NMDAR-dependent LTP, lets examine the structure and functions of these receptors that make them integral to the molecular mechanisms driving this process. The NMDA receptor is a non-selective cationic, glutamate receptor primarily located at dendritic spines where, through subunit-specific interactions, it connects to intracellular molecules of the postsynaptic multi-protein network, or postsynaptic density area, known as the PSD [@volianskis2015LongtermPotentiationRole]. NMDARs are heterotetramers commonly composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. They can also be found in other conformations having GluN3 subunits. There are different subunit subtypes, for example GluN2 can be found as GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C or GluN2D, and we know there are GluN3A and 3B isoforms too [@ciabarra1995CloningCharacterizationChi1; @kvist2013StructurebasedDiscoveryAntagonists]. 

The specific subunit composition of NMDARs influences their properties and functions. For example, a “GluN2B-GluN2A developmental switch” has been observed in rodents (and humans [@piggott19923HMK801]) where GluN2B is predominantly present in the early postnatal brain, but switches to GluN2A during early development. Eventually, GluN2A subunits become more numerous than GluN2B. These subtypes have different kinetics, and greater ratios of the GluN2B subunit leads to NMDA receptors that remain open for longer compared to those with more GluN2A [@liu2004SwitchingNMDAReceptor]. This may, in part, account for greater memory abilities in the immediate postnatal period compared to late in life [@bar-shira2015GeneExpressionSwitching]. 

NMDARs are primarily permeable to calcium ions and require both glutamate and glycine as ligands, with glutamate being the more common ligand and glycine serving as a co-agonist [@henneberger2013NMDA]. The binding of these ligands typically does not open the channel due to a voltage-dependent magnesium block, which is removed only once the neuron is sufficiently depolarized [@ruppersberg1994Mechanism]. This feature confers to NMDARs the role of a "coincidence detector" [@seeburg1995NMDA], as discussed further below [@sec-LTP-phases].

![NMDAR is a heterotetramer composed of four subunits, typically two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. A cross-sectional schematic of two subunits is shown in (A), alongside a structural model, and a simplified pictogram of the full tetrameric assembly is shown in (B). Each subunit has four major structural domains: the amino-terminal domain: ATD, the agonist-binding domain: ABD, the transmembrane domain: TMD, and the C-terminal domain: CTD. The ATD is located extracellularly at the top of the receptor and is primarily responsible for subunit assembly and allosteric modulation, helping regulate the receptor’s responsiveness. Ligands bind to the ABD site, glutamate binds to GluN2 subunits, while glycine binds to GluN1 subunits. Ligand binding at the ABD, together with membrane depolarization to relieve the voltage-dependent magnesium block, is necessary to open the ion channel. The TMD spans the cell membrane and forms the ion channel pore. It consists of three membrane-spanning helices: M1, M2, and M3, which collectively shape the channel’s permeability to calcium ($\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$), sodium ($\mathrm{Na^{+}}$), and potassium ($\mathrm{K^{+}}$) ions. The CTD is located intracellularly and serves as a platform for binding to various intracellular proteins, including scaffolding proteins and kinases. CaMKII binds with high affinity to the CTD of the GluN2B subunit. Panel (C) illustrates the domain structure of a GluN2B subunit, highlighting the location of the proximal and distal CaMKII binding regions within the intracellular CTD region (in grey).](20-biology_figures\NMDAR.png){#fig-NMDAR}

The binding of CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs is considered a critical step in triggering structural changes in dendritic spines following LTP induction. Compared to other subunits, CaMKII binds more readily to GluN2B [@strack1998Autophosphorylationdependent; @leonard2002Regulation; @barria2005NMDA], and this interaction appears to be a primary site involved in LTP mechanisms [@bayer2001Interactiona; @barria2005NMDA]. Specifically, the interaction between CaMKII and the intracellular region of the GluN2B subunit’s cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) plays a pivotal role in this process, as further discussed in @sec-CaMKII-NMDAR-association.

LTP is a process in which the strength of synaptic connections is enhanced, and it relies heavily on the activity of NMDARs as well as another important glutamate receptor, namely: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Both of these receptors are located on the PSD [@hunt2012Synaptic; @chater2014Role]. Although both are glutamate receptors, they have importantly different kinetics and channel properties.

AMPARs mediate rapid excitatory synaptic transmission, with a peak response time of approximately 200 μs and decay constants of around 2-3 ms [@jonas2000Time; @nielsen2004Modulation; @choquet2010Fast]. These receptors are primarily permeable to Na+ ions and are voltage-independent, enabling the swift influx of sodium into the postsynaptic neuron upon synaptic transmission. In contrast, NMDARs have a slower peak response time of approximately 10 ms and a decay constant of around 100 ms [@perouansky1993Kinetic; @kampa2004Kinetics; @tovar2017Modulating]. Their ion flow is regulated by their voltage-dependent magnesium block, which prevents ion entry at resting membrane potentials and requires sufficient depolarization for activation. Together, AMPARs and NMDARs work in concert to regulate synaptic plasticity. AMPARs mediate the initial rapid response to glutamate, while NMDARs are crucial for the longer-term changes in synaptic strength that underlie LTP (and LTD) [@turrigiano2000Hebb; @brown2022Synaptic]. 

![(_Top_) synaptic current traces are shown in response to glutamate receptor activation, with two distinct kinetic components. The fast component, represented by the blue trace, corresponds to AMPAR-mediated currents, which activate and deactivate rapidly. The slow component, shown in purple, corresponds to NMDAR-mediated currents, which have a slower activation and deactivation profile. The y-axis represents current amplitude in picoamperes (pA), while the x-axis represents time in milliseconds (ms). (_Bottom_) schematic diagram of synaptic transmission, highlighting the roles of AMPARs and NMDARs in excitatory synaptic signalling. Glutamate (Glu) can bind to both receptor types. AMPARs, mediate fast synaptic currents by allowing sodium ions ($\mathrm{Na^{+}}$) to enter the postsynaptic neuron. NMDARs mediate slow synaptic currents, allowing both calcium ($\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$) and sodium ($\mathrm{Na^{+}}$) ions inside the cell. NMDAR activation requires the removal of a magnesium ($\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$) block.](20-biology_figures\nmda-ampar.PNG){#fig-nmdar-ampar width="70%"}

### Dividing LTP into phases {#sec-LTP-phases}
LTP is typically divided into distinct phases: induction, expression, and maintenance. These phases describe the progression from the initial trigger of synaptic potentiation to the long-lasting changes in synaptic strength [@sweatt2010Chaptera]. To provide a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LTP, key molecular interactions associated with these phases are described next.

_Induction_ refers to the transient events that initiate the formation of LTP. This phase involves high-frequency (tetanic) stimulation of presynaptic fibres, which leads to the release of glutamate. Glutamate binds to both AMPARs and NMDARs on the postsynaptic membrane [@scheefhals2018Functional]. Importantly, although glutamate binds to NMDARs, this alone is typically insufficient to open the channel and let ions through due to the Mg2+ voltage block. In contrast, AMPARs' fast kinetics and voltage independence rapidly mediate membrane depolarisation by allowing Na⁺ influx into the postsynaptic cell [@otmakhova2002PathwaySpecific; @fuenzalida2010Role]. If this depolarisation is strong enough to remove the Mg²⁺ block from the NMDAR channel, Ca²⁺ influx through this channel is increased, initiating downstream signalling and setting the stage for LTP. NMDA receptors function as molecular coincidence detectors, permitting ion flux only when both agonist binding such as glutamate and membrane depolarisation coincide to activate the receptors. This mechanism ensures tight regulation of calcium entry, with elevated or reduced Ca²⁺ influx triggering LTP or LTD, respectively (see @fig-). This coincidence detection permits NMDARs to facilitate spike-timing dependent plasticity, where the precise timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity dictates whether plasticity results in potentiation or depression [@morrison2008Phenomenological; @fuenzalida2010Role; @stefanescu2015NMDA; @martinez-gallego2022Role].

_Expression and maintenance_ refer to the phases in which the molecular and cellular changes triggered during the induction phase are translated into long-lasting alterations in synaptic strength. These changes typically involve an increase in the number of receptors and their sensitivity [@reymann2007Late; @abraham2008LTP]. For instance, phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by proteins within the PSD enhances their ion conductance, thereby amplifying the postsynaptic response to glutamate [@sacktor2008Chapter; @purkey2020PhosphorylationDependent]. In addition, synaptic structure is often modified, with dendritic spines enlarging or new synaptic connections forming, further strengthening their connection [@sala2014Dendritic; @chidambaram2019Dendritic; @meldolesi2022PostSynapses]. Long-lasting alterations in intracellular signalling pathways, such as enhanced activation of protein kinases also contribute to the sustained strengthening of synaptic transmission [@mayford2007Protein]. Structural modifications, such as the enlargement of dendritic spines and cytoskeletal rearrangement mediated by actin polymerisation, support the long-term persistence of LTP. Protein synthesis, regulated by transcription factors like CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), also facilitates the production of proteins necessary for synaptic stabilisation [@lamprecht2004Structurala]. Additionally, scaffolding proteins, such as PSD-95, $\alpha$-actinin-2 and more, anchor AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic density [@debartolomeis2004Postsynaptic; @ivie2018ReproducibilityScientificComputing], ensuring their sustained incorporation into the synaptic membrane. These changes collectively enable the persistence of LTP, making it a robust mechanism for memory storage at the cellular level.

Additionally, LTP is often further categorised into early-phase LTP (E-LTP) and late-phase LTP (L-LTP), although an initial/short term potentiation and an intermediate phase of LTP have also been suggested [@huang1998Synaptic; @winder1998Genetic; @lisman2005Phases; @kumar2011LongTerm]. E-LTP occurs shortly after high-frequency stimulation of a synapse, and is typically characterized by a rapid increase in synaptic strength that lasts for a few minutes to hours. It relies primarily on the activation of NMDA receptors and the influx of calcium ions [@malenka1992Temporal; @frey1997Synaptic; @bliss2003How; @bliss2018Longterm]. L-LTP, on the other hand, is the prolonged phase of synaptic enhancement that can last for days or even weeks [@jackson1993Stereotypical; @harris1984Developmental; @muller1989Developmental; @bekenstein1991Vivo; @figurov1996Regulation; @mohns2008Synchronous]. L-LTP is dependent on new protein synthesis and gene expression. This phase is critical for the consolidation of memory and is associated with structural changes in the synapse, including the growth of dendritic spines and the synthesis of new receptors [@bliss2018Longterm; @baltaci2019Molecular].

The categorisation of LTP into distinct phases is not rigidly defined as strictly sequential; rather, the phases serve as distinct categories to help us talk about the different stages of LTP. Induction, expression, and maintenance can apply to both E-LTP and L-LTP; with E-LTP and L-LTP phases being _induced_ and _expressed_ in diverse ways (for example, through protein synthesis) [@pfeiffer2006Current; @abraham2008LTP] and _maintained_ for differing durations (for seconds, hours or longer) [@abraham2003Properties]. Additionally, E-LTP and L-LTP are not mutually exclusive. In fact, depending on the specific LTP induction protocol applied, E-LTP can happen concurrently with the development of L-LTP, with one gradually replacing the other over time [@roberson1996Biochemists; @bliss1993Synaptic; @kandel2001Molecular; @nicoll2003Expression; @malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @luscher2012NMDA]. This PhD research investigates the specific molecular interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs, primarily focusing on their roles in E-LTP induction and maintenance. 

### Molecular Signalling in LTP: Role of Calcium, CaMKII and Phosphatases {.unnumbered}

As previously noted, a key second messenger in NMDAR-dependent LTP is calcium. This ion drives signalling cascades through the activation of the intermediary Ca2+ sensitive protein calmodulin (CaM). During LTP, elevated Ca²⁺ influx activates CaM, which subsequently triggers several kinases, such as Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Ca²⁺-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) [@gnegy2000Ca2; @xia2005Role; @mohanan2022Role]. CaMKII has been shown to have several important effects during LTP. Namely, CaMKII is one of the main kinases that phopshorylates AMPARs, thereby elevating these receptor's channels conductance. CaMKII has also been shown to be important for the recruitment of AMPA receptors to the PSD following synaptic stimulation during LTP [@hayashi2000Driving; @herring2016LongTerm]. More recently, CaMKII binding to NMDARs has been proposed to be key for LTP induction and maintenance at synapses in the brain [@@bayer2024Revised]. 

In contrast to LTP, low levels of Ca2+ during LTD activates a cascade of competing signalling pathways. For instance, during LTD, CaM binds to and activates a well known phosphatase: calcineurin, also known as Protein Phosphatase 2B (PP2B) [@shibasaki2002Calcineurin]. Calcineurin can dephosphorylate the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors, reversing the phosphorylation that would normally enhance receptor activity and membrane insertion, thereby reducing synaptic strength [@kim2014Calcineurin; @zhou2024Calcineurin]. Other phosphatases, such as PP1 and PP2A play central roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity during both LTP and LTD. Their activities in LTP and LTD are determined by the relative levels of kinase and phosphatase activation, and their precise regulation ensures the appropriate strengthening or weakening of synapses during learning and memory processes [@munton2004Role; @colbran2004Protein; @belmeguenai2005Role]. 

![Molecular Signalling in Synaptic Plasticity: CaMKII in LTP and LTD Pathways. High frequency stimulation stimulation leads to LTP (left), characterised by a large and sustained Ca²⁺ influx through NMDARs. This activates CaM, which in turn stimulates CaMKII and PKC, promoting AMPAR phosphorylation and insertion into the PSD, strengthening synaptic transmission. During LTP, CaMKII isoforms associated to F-actin filaments separate from it and allow the dendritic spine to grow. Low-frequency stimulation induces LTD (right), where a smaller Ca²⁺ influx preferentially activates PP2B over CaMKII, leading to PP1 activation and AMPAR dephosphorylation. The downregulation of AMPARs from the synaptic membrane weakens synaptic transmission. Additionally, reduced CaMKII dissociation from actin filaments contributes to synaptic depression.](20-biology_figures\signalling_ltp_ltd.PNG){#fig-ltp-ltd width="95%"}

The spatial and temporal dynamics of calcium influx, which vary depending on the frequency and pattern of neuronal activity, therefore, are detected by proteins in the PSD and this triggers differing signalling cascades. Calcium signalling can then lead to opposing effects in NMDAR-dependent plasticity. But how exactly is this achieved? The answer likely lies in the specific positioning of key proteins involved in LTP and LTD near the NMDA receptor, enabling them to sense the subtle spatio-temporal variations in calcium influx and modulate downstream signalling accordingly. Hence, we can start to see how this PhD research is well positioned to investigate LTP mechanisms, particularly by focusing on the spatio-temporal dynamics of NMDARs and CaMKII. But why specifically focus on the interactions between these two proteins?

To answer this question, we can call back on the importance of how NMDA receptors' ability to act as a coincidence detector underpins hallmark features of LTP. NMDARs are essential mediators for the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP. Indeed, inhibition of these receptors in various regions of the hippocampus has been shown to prevent LTP induction, as well as lead to impairments in learning and memory in rodents [@collingridge1983Excitatory; @morris1986Selective]. Likewise, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout of NMDARs subunits have been shown to block LTP induction in rodent hippocampal circuits [@luscher2012NMDA; @hunt2012Synaptic; @alkadhi2021NMDA]. Moreover, over the past few decades, CaMKII has emerged as a critical molecule in the study of synaptic plasticity, with substantial evidence supporting its role as a key mediator of LTP [@lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction; @sanhueza2013CaMKII; @chang2017CaMKII; @nicoll2023Synapticc; @chen2024CaMKII]. In particular, its structural interaction with NMDARs seems to be a critical and minimal requirement for the induction of LTP, as we will see in the following @sec-camkii-properties.

It is helpful to distinguish here between molecules that act as mediators versus modulators during LTP. Mediators are key components of the molecular machinery directly responsible for LTP, they are essential and necessary. In contrast, modulators may influence the conditions under which LTP can occur, for example they may regulate the threshold for LTP induction or enhance its expression under certain conditions, but are not necessarily essential for LTP's occurrence. Although the line between these roles can sometimes be blurred, understanding this difference can be helpful for elucidating what are the minimal requirements for LTP and identifying additional factors that contribute to its modulation and enhancement. Evidence appears to point to CaMKII as a key player in orchestrating structural changes within the PSD following LTP, with the formation of a CaMKII/NMDAR complex being essential for both the induction and maintenance of LTP [@tao2021Synaptic; @nicoll2023Synapticc].

## CaMKII biophysical properties {#sec-camkii-properties}
CaMKII is expressed ubiquitously in animals, with four known isoforms $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ [@zalcman2018CaMKIIa; @tullis2023Distinct]. This study focuses on the brain specific $\alpha$ isoform, which constitutes up to 2% of total brain protein [@kennedy1983Biochemical; @chen2005Mass; @lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction]. $\alpha$-CaMKII is one of the main proteins in the PSD, and has extensively been shown to be important for LTP and memory formation [@hell2014CaMKII; @yasuda2022CaMKIIc]. Unless otherwise stated, references to CaMKII throughout this project will specifically pertain to $\alpha$-CaMKII. This kinase is a large holoenzyme consisting of 10 to 12 (and sometimes 14) subunits [@rosenberg2005StructureAutoinhibitedKinase; @chao2011Mechanismb; @myers2017CaMKII; @buonarati2021Conserved]. CaMKII holoenzymes are made up of two hexameric rings stacked together, where the association domain (or hub) holds the subunits together in a double-ring formation. Each of the subunits has a N-terminal catalytic/kinase domain (dark blue section @fig-CAMKII), followed by a regulatory domain that contains a self-inhibitory region and a binding site for the Ca2+/calmodulin complex (green and pink in @fig-CAMKII), the variable linker domain (grey section in @fig-CAMKII) and the C-terminal hub domain (light blue @fig-CAMKII). The kinase domain is the region that binds substrates and contains the ATP-binding site necessary for CaMKII phosphorylation [@pellicena2014CaMKII]. There is also a model proposed where CaMKII subunits have an S-site and T-site within the kinase domain where the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs binds to [@strack2000Mechanisma; @bayer2001Interaction], although this has recently been contested [@ozden2022CaMKII], as discussed in @sec-CaMKII-NMDAR-association.

### Docking and undocking of subunits
CaMKII subunits can be found docked (also known as "compact state"), or undocked (or extended); and open, or closed (@fig-CAMKII) [@hoffman2011Conformational; @bhattacharyya2020Structurala]. The docked/undocked states describe the compact or extended structure configurations of the CaMKII holoenzyme subunits, where the kinase domains are packed close to the central hub or not. The closed/open states refer to the conformational changes in the kinase and regulatory domains; these domains can adopt an "open" state, allowing interactions and kinase activity, or a "closed" state, in which the kinase and regulatory domain are bound together, reducing CaMKII's kinase activity [@nguyen2015Covert; @pandini2019Conformational; @bhattacharyya2020Flexible; @ozden2022CaMKIIb] (FIGURE). 

![camkii docked and undocked to be polished](20-biology_figures\camkii_docked_undocked.jpg)

https://elifesciences.org/articles/53670

https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/12/6/a035147.short

In the docked state, CaMKII subunits adopt a more compact configuration, where the regulatory domain is closely associated with the hub domain [@fig-CAMKII]. When CaMKII subunits are found in the docked state, they cannot autophosphorylate their neighbouring subunits, even if the subunits are open. This is because the compact shape does not allow the kinase domain of one subunit to structurally reach its neighbour [@rosenberg2005StructureAutoinhibitedKinase]. Therefore, it is thought that for CaMKII to have autphosphorylation activity, subunits need to be in an “open” and undocked conformation. Subunits in a docked, open state lack the structural capacity for autophosphorylation activity [@chao2011Mechanismb; @myers2017CaMKII]. In the undocked state, the regulatory domain is extended and separated from the hub domain. This conformation makes the subunits less compact and more “loose” which can facilitate interactions within subunits, and with other substrates. When undocked, CaMKII subunits can phosphorylate neighbours so long as they are in an open state as the kinase domain is structurally available to perform such function. If a subunit is undocked but closed, it lacks catalytic activity because its regulatory domain is bound to its catalytic site, preventing the kinase domain from being accessed or accessing targets [@chao2011Mechanism; @nguyen2015Covert]. 

### T286 phosphorylation and CaM binding
When CaMKII is in its closed conformation, structural constraints prevent CaM from interacting with the kinase [@singla2001Molecular; @hoffman2011Conformational; @gaertner2004Comparative]. In contrast, in the open conformation, CaMKII subunits can autophosphorylate each other at threonine 286 (T286) found in the regulatory segment, which prevents the segment from closing, and uncovers the binding sites in the kinase domain for CaMKIIs substrates and anchoring proteins. Importantly, in their open conformation, the calmodulin binding site in the regulatory segment of the CaMKII subunits becomes available for interaction [@gaertner2004Comparative; @chao2011Mechanism; @nguyen2015Covert; @rellos2010Structureb; @asciutto2021Physical]. Calmodulin binding is thought to stabilise CaMKII's subunits in their open conformation, facilitating further autophosphorylation among neighbouring subunits. What is more, binding of Ca2+/CaM has been shown to significantly increase the kinase's affinity for Ca2+/CaM itself [@meyer1992Calmodulin; @putkey1996Peptide], creating a feedforward loop. This means that as more Ca²⁺/CaM binds, it makes it easier for additional Ca²⁺/CaM to bind, which promotes further autophosphorylation and stabilisation of the kinase in its open conformation [@chao2011Mechanism; @nguyen2015Covert]. 

CaMKII's increased autophosphorylation capability allows it to retain an _autonomous activity_, indepedent of calcium/calmodulin binding, even after the initial calcium signal has faded [@braun1995Multifunctional; @miller1986Regulation; @coultrap2010CaMKIIa; @buard2010CaMKII; @chang2017CaMKII]. This autonomous activation is thought to be important for memory formation and synaptic modification, as it allows CaMKII to sustain long-term changes in cellular activity, ensuring that modifications are maintained over time. Likewise, T286 autophosphorylation and CaM trapping play a crucial role in conferring frequency-dependent activation of CaMKII. Experimental studies with purified CaMKII have shown that the enzyme responds differently to varying frequencies and durations of Ca²⁺ spikes [@dekoninck1998Sensitivity; @chang2017CaMKII]. This frequency dependence is thought to enable CaMKII to act as a frequency decoder of synaptic inputs.

![_The dual role of Ca2+/CaM and Thr286 phosphorylation allows frequency detection of threshold to induce autonomous activity. (A) At low frequency Ca2+ spikes, Ca2+/CaM can bind to CaMKII and dissociate between intervals. (B) At higher frequencies with spike intervals in the range of Ca2+/CaM dissociation time, additional Ca2+/CaM molecules can bind to adjacent CaMKII subunits before all the initial Ca2+/CaM molecules dissociate._](20-biology_figures\freq_detector.PNG){#fig-freq_detector width=70%}

In the literature, the term 'CaMKII activity' can sometimes be used intercheably when referring to CaMKII subunits being in their open state [@nicoll2005Synaptic; @pharris2019Multistate], being bound to CaM [@nicoll2005Synaptic; @rellos2010Structureb], and/or being phosphorylated, typically at the T286 site [@nicoll2005Synaptic; @rellos2010Structureb; @lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction]. However, these states are distinct and do not necessarily correspond to 'activity'. In this context, we therefore clarify that we define different types of activity: CaMKII can have enzymatic activity, which refers to the protein’s ability to catalyse the phosphorylation of downstream substrates, and autonomous activity, where CaMKII remains open even after Ca2+/CaM dissociates. 

Furthermore, CaM binding is commonly considered to induce activation [@hoffman2011Conformational; @yasuda2022CaMKIIc], further obtusing the meaning behind CaM binding and CaMKII activation. However, studies have demonstrated that CaMKII can exhibit enzymatic activity even in the absence of CaM-induced activation, albeit at a reduced level[@erickson2008Dynamic; @rellos2010Structureb; @bhattacharyya2020Flexible], which challenges the notion that CaM binding is synonymous with CaMKII activation. 

This leads to the discussion of an 'induced fit' model versus a 'conformational change' model. In the former, an activator binds to the enzyme and induces a conformational change. For instance, CaM binding facilitates the opening of the CaMKII subunit. In contrast, a 'conformational selection' model suggests that the enzyme can exist in both active and inactive conformations independently, with the activator selectively binding to and stabilizing the active conformation, without _inducing_ a conformational change. Moreover, within cells, signaling cascades and events do not occur in a sequential, orderly fashion; rather, they happen simultaneously, with random events occurring at various locations and times. Therefore, in this dissertation, the conformational change approach is considered more appropriate to describe the interaction leading to CaMKII activation. 

### CaMKII T305/306 phosphorylation {#sec-t305-p}
Two additional phosphorylation sites, T305 and T306, are thought to provide CaMKII with important autoregulatory functions, although their exact functions and mechanisms are not fully understood. It has been shown that following T286 phosphorylation, this site can become phosphorylated shortly after, and it is thought that these two sites can autophosphorylate each other [@hanson1992Inhibitory]. Located within the CaM binding segment, phosphorylation of the T305/306 site prevents CaM from binding to the enzyme. Similarly, if CaM is bound, these sites cannot undergo phosphorylation [@hanson1992Inhibitory; @colbran1993Inactivation]. 

Unlike T286 phosphorylation, phosphorylation at T305/306 does not prevent CaMKII subunits from closing [@cook2021CaMKIIb]. This, together with the fact that it prevents CaM from binding, increases the likelihood that T305/306 phosphorylated subunits adopt the closed state. In the closed state, the kinase's catalytic activity is reduced, as the kinase domain is inaccessible. Therefore, T305/306 phosphorylation is often described as reducing CaMKII’s catalytic activity, or being an "inhibitory phosphorylation" [@chang2019Mechanisms; @yasuda2022CaMKII]. Phosphorylation at T305/306 has been proposed to act as a form of kinetic proofreading, ensuring CaMKII remains inactive or less active unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. This mechanism would prevent premature or excessive kinase activation, enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signalling in response to synaptic activity [@ordyan2020Interactionsb; @cook2021CaMKIIb; @bayer2024Revised].

### CaMKII association with NMDARs: enzymatic vs structural roles in LTP {#sec-CaMKII-NMDAR-association}
One of the most popular theories for memory in molecular neuroscience has been that LTP induction (and potentially maintenance) requires enzymatic activity of CaMKII @[@buard2010CaMKII; @lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction; @coultrap2014Autonomous; @chang2017CaMKII; @cook2021CaMKIIb]. The enzymatic action of CaMKII has two types of targets. First, itself, as T286 autophosphorylation maintains the enzyme in the open/active, and autonomous, conformation. Secondly, CaMKIIs enzymatic action also targets the phosphorylation of various downstream target proteins, such as the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, or the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, among others [@nicoll2023Synaptic]. 

The role of T286 phosphorylation in CaMKII activity and LTP has long been debated. Historically, T286 autophosphorylation was thought to be essential for LTP induction, as early studies showed that T286A mutant mice, unable to phosphorylate at this site, showed impaired LTP [@giese1998Autophosphorylation; @ohno2002Pharmacogenetic; @vigil2016CaMKII]. However, these conclusions were based on correlation rather than causation. While T286 phosphorylation enhances CaMKII function and may strengthen LTP, the mutation’s effects could stem from a failure to activate CaMKII through alternative mechanisms, rather than proving an absolute requirement for phosphorylation. A T286A mutation alone does not isolate the effects of T286 phosphorylation from confounding factors, such as disrupted binding or altered localisation of CaMKII.

Recent work by @rumian2024LTP have shed light into this using hippocampal slices from T286A mutant mice. Since T286A CaMKII cannot phosphorylate at T286, any LTP observed in these mutants must occur via a mechanism independent of T286 phosphorylation. Remarkably, high-frequency stimulation still induced LTP in T286A slices when the ATP-competitive CaMKII inhibitor AS283 was applied. This finding demonstrates that T286 phosphorylation is indeed not necessary for LTP induction. Furthermore, since AS283 inhibits CaMKII enzymatic activity, this study also shows that kinase activity is not required for LTP induction. The relative significance of CaMKIIs T286 autophosphorylation, phosphorylation and binding of downstream target proteins, continues to be a subjet of intense debate [@buard2010CaMKII; @sanhueza2011Role; @chang2017CaMKII; @cook2022CaMKIIb]. Much of the uncertainty in interpreting studies that inhibit CaMKII enzymatic activity and its exact role in LTP arises from the fact that some CaMKII enzymatic inhibitors also disrupt CaMKII's structural functions, particularly its binding to the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors. 

In this context, at the turn of the century, research by @bayer2001Interactiona demonstrated that the binding of GluN2B and CaMKII could induce autonomous CaMKII activity.  The proposed mechanism for CaMKII and NMDAR binding was that the CTD of the NMDAR, which has homology to CaMKIIs regulatory segment, binds to the kinase domain in its place [FIGURE]. This idea presents a paradox: as binding of the regulatory domain to the kinase domain is typically known to inhibit the kinase, rendering it inactive/closed. Thus, with this explanation, it would be expected that the GluN2B CTD would inhibit the kinase rather than keep it persistently active. A long-standing proposed mechanism to explain how the CTD peptide can keep CaMKII in its constitutive active state, is that one end of the GluN2B CTD may act as a wedge at the T site (for Thr286 binding) of the CaMKII subunit, preventing the autoinhibitory segment from reassociating, while the other end remains loosely bound to the active S site (for substrate binding), allowing substrates to interact with the kinase [@bayer2001Interaction; @bayer2006Transition; @nicoll2023Synaptic]. 

draw diagram and add -Importantly, the CaMKII/GluN2B complex was also shown to endure for hours even after dissociation of CaM from the kinase [@barcomb2016CaMKIIa].

However, recent crystal structure studies of CaMKII subunits challenge this two-site-binding model, and show that CaMKII substrates, including GluN2B among other activator petptides, bind to a single continuous site across the kinase domain [@ozden2022CaMKIIb]. This finding highlights a salt bridge interaction, located far from the active S site, that enhances the binding affinity of CaMKII for activator peptides such as GluN2B. These high-affinity interactions are believed to sustain CaMKII's enzymatic activity by keeping the subunits in an open, active conformation. But how, as we face the same paradox as before? @ozden2022CaMKIIb propose that that GluN2B binding is able to maintain CaMKII subunits in their open conformation by displacing the regulatory segment, triggering a conformational change that causes the αD helix, a structural feature within the kinase domain, to rotate outward. This outward shift stabilises the kinase in its active form, preventing the regulatory segment from reassociating and allowing CaMKII to remain catalytically active.

Although the exact mechanism by which CaMKII and NMDAR bind to form a complex is not yet fully understood, existing evidence consistently indicates that CaMKII subunits interact with the CTD of NMDARs, and that this structural complex plays a crucial role in LTP. In fact, there is increasing evidence supporting a structural model in which LTP is maintained through the binding of CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit, independent of CaMKII's enzymatic activity [@sanhueza2011Role]. @halt2012CaMKIIc showed that disrupting CaMKII/GluN2B binding using peptides that block this interaction such as CN21, prevented LTP even when CaMKII kinase activity was intact. More recently, there have been some key studies [REFERENCES] that focused on finding the minimal requirements for the ability of CaMKII to enhance synaptic transmission and its role in LTP maintenance. Although these studies were conducted independently, they both arrived at a similar conclusion: the role of T286 phosphorylation in CaMKII during LTP may not be primarily enzymatic. 

Instead, it may serve to enable and stabilize the CaMKII/GluN2B complex that is _essential_ for regulating synaptic CaMKII accumulation and supporting the associated structural functions of CaMKII required for LTP. In other words, T286 phosphorylation modulates (not mediates) the initial signal processing that triggers LTP induction, enabling a downstream response via CaMKII's structural functions without requiring enzymatic activity. It is these structural functions of CaMKII that are, therefore, more likely to meet the essential and minimum molecular requirements for LTP induction and maintenance [@kim2016Interplay; @ozden2022CaMKII], though the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The CaMKII/NMDAR complex may enable activity-dependent CaMKII incorporation into postsynaptic sites, potentially acting as a structural seed to recruit postsynaptic density proteins, contributing to synapse restructuring and plasticity.

In addition to forming a complex with GluN2B, CaMKII can phosphorylate the S1303 site at the GluN2B CTD. However, while the CaMKII-NMDAR binding complex is likely essential for synaptic function during LTP, S1303 phosphorylation does not appear to be necessary [@lisman2012Mechanisms; @goodell2017DAPK1; @goodell2017DAPK1; @tullis2021GluN2B]. Recent mutagenesis studies detected increased S1303 phosphorylation after induced chemical LTD, but not after LTP, suggesting  that S1303 phosphorylation may be more relevant to synaptic weakening rather than strengthening. It is known that CaMKII and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), another kinase of the CaMK family, competes for binding to the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs [@goodell2017DAPK1; @goodell2017DAPK1]. Recently, it has been posited that S1303 may act as a point of convergence for these kinases to modulate GluN2B-containing NMDARs. S1303 phosphorylation may play a more critical role in LTD, as DAPK1, which inhibits CaMKII binding, targets this site and initiates the molecular cascade leading to LTD. In summary, the precise mechanism of CaMKII binding to the NMDAR CTD remains unclear. And while it is known that CaMKII can phosphorylate S1303 in the NMDAR, this phosphorylation function remains enigmatic; the primary function of CaMKII binding to the receptor seems to be mainly structural during LTP [@tullis2021GluN2B].

Regarding LTD, phosphorylation at T305/306, unlike T286, has been more readily observed during LTD [@pi2010Autonomousa; @coultrap2014Autonomous] and is suggested to direct the signalling cascade toward LTD [@bayer2024Revised], although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Specifically, phosphorylation at these sites seems to be important when CaMKII binds to GluN2B of NMDARs. Some studies suggest that phosphorylation at these sites inhibits binding to GluN2B (REFERENCES:  Barcomb et al., 2014; Elgersma et al., 2002), while others propose that binding to GluN2B suppresses T305/306 phosphorylation (REFERENCE: Bayer et al., 2001). Interestingly, REFERENCE Barcomb et al. (2014) demonstrated that a phosphomimic T305/306D CaMKII mutant retained its ability to bind GluN2B without significant reduction. This finding suggests that T305/306 phosphorylated CaMKII can still bind to GluN2B, challenging the idea that T305/306 phosphorylation directly inhibits binding, and that indeed CaMKII can bind to GluN2B and phosphorylate at T305/306 at the same time. 

If phosphorylation at T305/306 makes CaMKII more likely to be in a "closed" state (see @sec-t305-p), this would reduce its likelihood of binding to GluN2B. In other words, it is not the phosphorylation itself that directly inhibits binding, but rather that the kinase, when phosphorylated at T305/306, is more likely to be in a closed state, which in turn reduces its chances of binding with NMDARs. This explanation, however, does not fully account for the observed reduction in T305/306 phosphorylation once CaMKII is bound to the GluN2B subunit [barcomb et al and more references]. It remains unclear whether binding to GluN2B directly suppresses T305/306 phosphorylation or if another mechanism is at play. Testing this possibility could involve designing experiments to monitor T305/306 phosphorylation levels in CaMKII while it is actively bound to GluN2B, [EXAMPLES NOT SURE]_

Another well-known CaMKII substrate site is S831 (and, to a lesser extent, S845) on the CTD of the AMPAR subunit GluA1. CaMKII phosphorylation of S831 in GluA1 increases AMPAR single-channel conductance, enhancing sodium ion flow into the postsynaptic neuron upon glutamate activation. This enhanced conductance of AMPARs can also result in a larger excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), which strengthens synaptic connections. The greater influx of sodium ions through phosphorylated AMPARs can lead to a more substantial depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. This depolarization can facilitate further calcium entry through NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which is critical for LTP induction as dicussed above. By increasing the activity and efficiency of AMPARs, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit can help stabilize synaptic changes over time. It is also proposed that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ CaMKII isoforms activation and their postsynaptic translocation induces the synaptic trapping of AMPARs diffusing in the membrane, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear [@diaz-alonsoLongterm; @opazo2010CaMKII; @patriarchi2018Postsynaptic; @hell2014CaMKII]. Notably, while CaMKII phosphorylation of GluA1 is important for mediating LTP mechanisms, strong evidence suggests that this may not be essential for LTP. LTP could still be observed _in vivo_ in knock-in mice lacking the CTD of GluA1 subunit in AMPA receptors. Additionally, LTP was also observed _in vitro_ when the GluA1 C-tail was transfected in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Instead, what may be necessary is a reserve pool of glutamate receptors independent of subunit type [@lee2010Specific; @diaz-alonsoLongterm; @granger2013LTP]. These findings further support the idea that the essential requirement for molecular LTP induction and maintenance may be the CaMKII/NMDAR interactions studied in this PhD. 

Ultimately, any structural LTP mechanism must regulate the filamentous (F)-actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines. Changes in spine shape and size are closely linked to actin remodelling, which affects the strength of excitatory synaptic connections. During LTP induction, the balance between F-actin polymerization and degradation is transiently altered. Dendritic spine morphogenesis involves many actin-binding proteins and signaling pathways, and our protein of interest, CaMKII, is situated upstream of the signalling pathway leading to F-actin modification [REFERENCES]. Notably, the $\beta$-CaMKII isoform has been shown to have direct structural roles in binding and bundling F-actin filaments [REFERENCES]. In its inactive, closed conformation, the $\beta$-CaMKII isoform is is bound to and crosslinked with F-actin filaments via the variable linker between the regulatory and association domains. This binding limits access of actin-regulating proteins to F-actin and stabilizes spine structure. Upon calcium influx through NMDARs after postsynaptic stimulation, autophosphorylayted $\alpha$-CaMKII can translocate from the PSD to interact with $\beta$-CaMKII, eventually leading to autophosphorylation of T287 in the latter isoform [REFERENCE]. This autophosphorylation releases $\beta$-CaMKII from F-actin, enabling actin remodelling via other actin regulators [REFERENCE]. Actin filaments subsequent reassociation stabilises the restructured F-actin for extended periods of time [REFERENCE]. Thus, the activity-dependent dissociation of $\beta$-CaMKII from F-actin may be of importace for actin dynamics remodelling that may allow dendritic spine plasticity and synaptic reorganization during LTP [REFERENCES]. It has been demonstrated that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ isoforms of CaMKII can directly interact with the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. However, it is the $\alpha$ isoform, rather than the $\beta$, that is proposed to facilitate the activity-dependent incorporation of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex into postsynaptic sites [REFERENCES https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12873385/]. This process may act as a structural scaffold, recruiting postsynaptic density proteins and contributing to synaptic restructuring and plasticity. Consequently, these two primary neuronal isoforms appear to have distinct roles in neuronal plasticity, with $\alpha$-CaMKII regulating synaptic strength and $\beta$-CaMKII influencing dendritic morphology.

### What we don't know {.unnumbered}
Alltogether, there is strong evidence showing CaMKII and NMDAR interactions play a critical role during LTP [REFERENCE], however, many questions remain unanswered. For example, what role does the binding of CaMKII and NMDAR have in the different phases of LTP? While it is well-established that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex helps maintain CaMKII in an enzymatically active state, this enzymatic activity has not been proven to be an essential requirement for the induction or maintenance of LTP [REFERENCES https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01809-x]. Rather, the evidence seems to suggest it is necessary for the expression phase of LTP [REFERENCE].

What is more, the precise mechanism of how CaMKII and NMDAR interactions form a complex is also hotly debated. As discussed above, longstanding model posited that CaMKII binds to two distinct sites on the NMDAR C-terminal [REFERENCES]. However, recent crystal structure studies challenge this by suggesting that CaMKII substrates and activators interact at a single continuous site on the kinase domain [REFERENCE]. A more recent review offers a refined perspective, suggesting that CaMKII binds continuously through its S and T sites on the kinase domain, with these sites acting in concert to mediate binding to the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. Furthermore, although docking of CaMKII to GluN2B subunits is emerging as a key candidate for mediating the structural changes associated with LTP, the connection between this interaction and subsequent changes that affect the cytoskeleton’s structure remains unclear. 

Another unresolved question is the exact role of T305/306 phosphorylation in regulating CaMKII activity. Evidence suggests that this phosphorylation acts as a regulatory mechanism, influencing signalling pathways associated with both LTP and LTD, with increased T305/306 phosphorylation seemingly promoting LTD. As previously discussed, T305/306 phosphorylation has been proposed to function as a form of kinetic proofreading, ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive or less active unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are detected. This mechanism would serve to prevent premature or excessive activation of the kinase, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signalling in response to synaptic activity. However, there is ongoing debate within the experimental literature regarding whether T305/306 phosphorylation alone inhibits LTP and facilitates LTD, or if its effects are mediated in concert with the activation of competing kinases, such as DAPK1, in regulating the bidirectional processes of LTP and LTD [REFERENCES].

These questions underscore the importance of further research into the dynamics of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions. Gaining a clearer understanding of these interactions may shed light on the biochemical processes that stabilise memories and provide crucial insights into LTP and memory formation. Therefore, this PhD research of relevance and is well positioned to allow us to test the minimal requirements of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions while considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of CaMKII activity using computer models of these interactions.

### Research objectives of this PhD:

These findings underscore the importance of further research into the dynamics of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions. Gaining a clearer understanding of these interactions may shed light on the molecular processes that lead to LTP and memory formation. As discussed, although it seems apparent that the interaction between CaMKII and NMDARs is crucial for LTP [REFERENCES], the exact mechanism in which their interaction is influencing LTP remains unclear. The overarching research objective of this PhD is to understand how CaMKII and NMDAR receptors interact in a postsynaptic dendrite after calcium entry, mimicking the induction phase of LTP. To this end, I have the following specific aims:

**Aim 1.** Develop a computational model of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions based on published models and known findings on CaMKII regulation. This way, the model itself functions as a testable hypothesis that synthesises literature knowledge about CaMKII/NMDAR interactions.

**Aim.** Perform parameter sweeps for reaction rates that have not been measured experimentally. This allows mapping the model's response to parameter changes and determining plausible ranges of the unknown parameters.

**Aim 2.** Determine in detail how functional states of CaMKII contribute to stabilizing the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, defined as achieving long-lasting binding that reaches equilibrium. This includes investigating how conformational states of CaMKII and phosphorylation events influence the stability of the complex.

does cam binding make a difference to camkii/nmdar binding 

camkii_p free from cam binds more readily to nmdars than when camkii_p is bound to cam

does our model show that camkii_p, independent of cam binding, binds more readily than when camkii is free from cam binding? id expect camkii_p to be found bound to nmdar independently of cam_bound_camkii, so higher number of camkii_p_camfree, and less of camkii_p_cam_ca4

**Aim 3.** Investigate how CaMKII/NMDAR binding influences CaMKII activity and function by examining an _in silico_ mutation model where CaMKII-NMDAR interaction is disrupted. 

**Aim 4.** Investigate how CaMKII phosphorylation influences CaMKII/NMDAR binding by examining an _in silico_ mutation model where CaMKII cannot be phosphorylated at key functional residues.  

**Aim** reproducibility. model follows fair principles. for details see chapter...
**aim** ethics - data hazards.

**Aim 4.** Investigate how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions influence CaMKII activity, as well as how different conditions of CaMKII binding and phosphorylation affect the stability and function of the complex. 

- How CaMKII activity and function change in a model where CaMKII cannot bind NMDARs, compared to one where it can.

- Whether CaMKII that is phosphorylated at T286 and bound to CaM exhibits a higher likelihood of binding to NMDARs, even if this is not explicitly defined in the model.

- The role of phosphorylation in CaMKII/NMDAR binding, given that the model does not define binding as a direct function of phosphorylation.

- How wild-type and mutant CaMKII variants behave, particularly those that cannot undergo phosphorylation at T286 and T306 or bind to NMDARs.

how do i know equilibrium has been reached? how is this tested quantitaviely. a definition of equilibrium, and by that definition is the answer yes or no. 

what do you expect the steady state to be? eigen values, in a linear setting, how is it determined with ssa? statistic to extract from the data, something like smoothing the data, smooth version of what i have. maybe look at variance. stde/mean. coefficient variation greater than x then thats the steady state. and some visual checking. 

how long has it been seen that camkii/nmdar are bound together in research - be specific about timeframe. 

functional consequencies of camkii/nmdar binding

if a model of camkii that cannot bind to nmdars then what is the result in camkii actiity and functions (vs a model of camkii that can bind nmdar)

i expect camkii that is t286 and cam bound to be bound more readily to nmdar (even though this is not explicitly defined).

binding camkii/nmdar is not defined by a function of phosphorylation in this model

wt camkii and mt camkii cannot t286 and t306 phospho
wt camkii and mt camkii cannot bind to nmdar

draw out hypothesis.
