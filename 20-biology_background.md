# Introduction to LTP, CaMKII and NMDARs

To situate this PhD within its broader biological context, it is essential to first outline the theoretical and practical knowledge frameworks underpinning this research. This background chapter will provide an overview of key concepts relevant to the study, establishing the foundational understanding needed to appreciate both the aims and implications of the work carried out here onwards. 

## Long Term Potentiation underlies learning and memory

The cellular changes that underline different forms of memory are thought to involve changes in the strength of neuronal connections. Over a century ago, @ramonycajal1909HistologieSystemeNerveux proposed that the nervous system is composed of microscopic, independent cells —neurons— that form intricate networks of connections. The notion that synaptic strength changes during learning and memory was refined into a concrete model by @hebb1949OrganizationBehaviorNeuropsychological. Hebb proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time, the synapses between them are strengthened. The first mechanism supporting synaptic strengthening, long-term potentiation (LTP), was then discovered in the late 1960s using rabbits' hippocampus _in vitro_. This discovery of LTP showed that short, high frequency stimulation (tetanus) of hippocampal excitatory synapses produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the strength of these synapses that could persist for many days [@bliss1973Longlasting]. 

In 1986, Morris et al. provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories _in vivo_ using rats [@morris1986Selective]. These rats were trained in the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which the rodents swam in a pool of murky water until they located a platform hidden beneath the surface. During this exercise, the rats had no other choice but to learn the location of the hidden platform through salient cues placed at specific positions around the maze's circumference. After the rats had memorised where the cues and platforms were, one group was subjected to having their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while another group to whom nothing was done to, served as the control. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool. However, the rats that had been subjected to APV treatment had significantly impaired memory. Moreover, when both groups were killed and slices of their hippocampal slices were analyzed, LTP was readily induced in the control group, while it could not be induced in the brains of the rats subjected to APV treatment. This experiment using rats provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory. In the years since, there have been many more experiments conducted on rodents, often using fear conditioning or subjecting them to brain injuries, that provide further evidence of LTP's role in different types of memory and learning [@lynch2004LongTerm; @dringenberg2020History; @vorhees2024Tests; @park2024Fear].

Since its discovery, different forms of LTP have been observed throughout different regions in the brain, in human and non-human animals [@chen1996Longterm; @beck2000Synaptic; @nicoll2017BriefHistoryLongTerm; @spriggs2019Human]. What is more, the different forms of LTP further depend on a number of factors such as developmental stage, pre- or post-synaptic stimulation as well as stimulation protocols. Two main types of LTP have been described as being either NMDA receptor-dependent or NMDA receptor-independent [@kumar2011LongTerm; @grover1992Nmethyldaspartate; @cavus1996Two]. For example, at the CA3–CA1 hippocampal synapses, when using high-frequency stimulation, LTP was shown to be dependent on the NMDA receptor [@collingridge1983Excitatory; @harris1984Longterm; @morris1986Selective], whereas at the same synapses, an NMDA-independent form of LTP can be induced by using a 200-Hz stimulation protocol [@grover1990Two; @grover1998Evidence], among other stimulation protocols [@aou2003Orexinhypocretin1; @rebola2008Adenosine; @erondu1985RegionalDistributionType; @bortolotto1999Roles; @zi1993Induction; @bortolotto1993Characterisation]. Similarly, LTP at CA1 synapses, which can be representative of LTP at excitatory synapses, is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and primarily involves a modification of the postsynaptic neuron. Mossy fibre LTP at CA3 pyramidal cells, on the other hand, is independent of NMDA receptors and has been shown to be entirely expressed presynaptically [@nicoll2005SynapticPlasticityHippocampal]. This project will focus on studying the NMDA receptor-dependent form of LTP at synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To avoid ambiguities, this is the type of LTP discussed unless otherwise stated. 

LTP is usually divided into two main phases: early (E-LTP) and late LTP (L-LTP), although an initial/short term potentiation and an intermediate phase of LTP have also been suggested [@huang1998Synaptic; @winder1998Genetic; @lisman2005Phases; @kumar2011LongTerm; ]. E-LTP occurs shortly after high-frequency stimulation of a synapse, and is typically characterized by a rapid increase in synaptic strength that lasts for a few minutes to hours. It relies primarily on the activation of NMDA receptors and the influx of calcium ions [@malenka1992Temporal; @frey1997Synaptic; @bliss2003How; @bliss2018Longterm]. L-LTP, on the other hand, is the prolonged phase of synaptic enhancement that can last for days or even weeks. As revealed by tetanic stimulation producing L-LTP at postnatal day 15 (P15) in CA1 rat hippocampus, i.e. in rats that were bred for this and killed at 15 days of age [@jackson1993Stereotypical; @harris1984Developmental], as well as observed _in vivo_ on rats ranging from 6 to 60 days of age [@muller1989Developmental;@bekenstein1991Vivo; @figurov1996Regulation; @mohns2008Synchronous]. L-LTP is dependent on new protein synthesis and gene expression. This phase is critical for the consolidation of memory and is associated with structural changes in the synapse, including the growth of dendritic spines and the synthesis of new receptors [@bliss2018Longterm]. Within these phases, LTP is also often divided into three main events: induction, expression, and maintenance. _Induction_ refers to the transient events that initiate the formation of LTP. _Maintenance_ refers to a persisting biochemical signal that lasts in the neurons. This lasting biochemical signal influences an effector, such as a glutamate receptor like NMDARs, leading to the _expression_ of LTP [@sweatt2010Chaptera].

These three events are not rigidly defined as sequential phases of LTP; rather, they serve as distinct categories to help us talk about the different stages of LTP. Induction, expression, and maintenance can apply to both E-LTP and L-LTP; with E-LTP and L-LTP phases being _induced_ and _expressed_ in diverse ways (for example, through protein synthesis) [@pfeiffer2006Current; @abraham2008LTP] and _maintained_ for differing durations (for seconds, hours or longer) [@abraham2003Properties]. Additionally, E-LTP and L-LTP are not mutually exclusive. In fact, depending on the specific LTP induction protocol applied, E-LTP can happen concurrently with the development of L-LTP, with one gradually replacing the other over time [@roberson1996Biochemists]. This PhD research focuses on the role of specific molecular interactions that happen during E-LTP induction and maintenance, as discussed in the following sections.

### LTP as an attractive model to explain memory at the cellular and molecular level

To this day, LTP remains an attractive model to explain memory at the cellular and molecular level due to some of its properties. These properties include the principles of associativity, cooperativity, input-specificity, and persistence [baltaci2019Molecular]. The associativity principle indicates that a weak tetanic stimulation that activates only a few fibers does not induce LTP. However, simultaneous strong stimulation of a neighboring pathway can induce LTP in both synaptic pathways (REFERENCE: Levy and Steward, 1979). Cooperativity can be observed when a weak stimulation is paired with a strong postsynaptic depolarization. In this case, LTP is induced only if the postsynaptic cell is depolarized within approximately 100ms of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic cell. Input-specificity stipulates that LTP occurs only in the synaptic pathway that received the tetanic stimulation, whilst inactive synapses that contact the same neuron will not share synaptic enhancement (REFERENCE: Andersen et al., 1977; Lynch et al., 1977). Together, these characteristics set conditional requirements that are likely to allow selective strengthening of specific synaptic connections thought to be involved in memory storage. In regards to persistence, LTP has been shown to last for several hours in _in vitro_ slice preparations and for many months in freely moving animals (in vivo; Abraham, 2003), suggesting a capacity for sustained physiological changes that aligns well with memory formation. 

Numerous molecular and cellular mechanisms are known to contribute to the induction, expression, and maintenance of LTP [@bliss1993Synaptic; @kandel2001Molecular; @nicoll2003Expression; @malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @luscher2012NMDA]. This PhD centres on LTP induction and maintenance within the postsynaptic dendrite, framing the story of LTP from the perspective of these postsynaptic processes. E-LTP is induced when the intracellular calcium concentration in the postsynaptic cell rises above a critical threshold. The influx of Ca²⁺ into the cell is facilitated by NMDA receptors, which are ionotropic, non-selective cationic glutamate receptors essential for the rapid regulation of synaptic plasticity. The activation of the NMDA receptor is regulated by a voltage-dependent magnesium (Mg++) block within the channel's pore. For the Mg++ ion to be expelled from the pore, membrane depolarization is required. Once this occurs, calcium ions can pass through it. As a result, these receptors act as molecular coincidence detectors, allowing ion flux only when these conditions are met. This is a critical aspect of NMDA receptor regulation, enabling the receptor to play a unique role in molecular-level information processing.

Tetanic stimulation of presynaptic fibers leads to the release of neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate, onto the membrane of the postsynaptic cell. Glutamate binding to postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors triggers an influx of positively charged sodium ions into the postsynaptic cell, leading to cell depolarization. The magnitude of depolarization determines the amount of Ca2+ entry into the postsynaptic cell. If the degree of depolarization is sufficient to remove the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor as mentioned before, then the channel will allow influx of Ca2+ into the cell. This influx then leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of dendritic spines, which are specialized protrusions on neurons that serve as the primary sites for excitatory synaptic transmission. Following the entry of calcium, the ions can bind to calmodulin (CaM) to form a Ca2+/CaM complex that is recognized by multiple enzymes. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is one of the primary targets of the Ca²⁺/CaM complex. This interaction triggers a molecular signaling cascade that ultimately induces reshaping of the synaptic strcuture and physiology, as well as regulating gene expression essential for memory formation. 

## CaMKII and NMDARs functions in LTP

CaMKII is expressed ubiquitously in animals, with four known isoforms $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ [REFERENCES]. This study focuses on the brain specific $\alpha$ isoform, which constitutes up to 2% of total brain protein. $\alpha$-CaMKII is one of the main proteins in the PSD, and has extensively been shown to be important for LTP and memory formation [REFERENCES]. Unless otherwise stated, references to CaMKII throughout this project will specifically pertain to $\alpha$-CaMKII. This kinase is a large holoenzyme consisting of 10/12 subunits [REFERENCES]. Each of the subunits has a catalytic/kinase domain, followed by a regulatory domain that contains a self-inhibitory region and a binding site for the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) complex [FIGURE]. At its basal state, CaMKII is found with its subunits mostly in their closed, inactive state where the regulatory domain is bound to the kinase domain [FIGURE]. In the open conformation, CaMKII subunits can autophosphorylate each other at threonine 286 (T286) found in the inhibitory segment, which prevents the segment from closing, and uncovers the binding sites in the kinase domain for CaMKIIs substrates and anchoring proteins. This autophosphorylation event allows CaMKII to remain in an autonomous, calcium/calmodulin-independent active form, which permits activity to persist even after the initial calcium stimulus has passed [REFERENCES]. In fact, one of the most popular theories for memory in molecular neuroscience has been that LTP induction (and potentially maintenance) requires enzymatic activity of CaMKII [REFERENCES]. The enzymatic action of CaMKII has two types of targets, first, itself, as autophosphorylation maintains the enzyme in the open, active, and autonomous, conformation. Secondly, CaMKIIs enzymatic action also targets the phosphorylation of various downstream target proteins, such as the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, or the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. 

The T286 autophosphorylation mechanism of CaMKII has long been proposed as a critical requirement for LTP induction. Interestingly, studies using pharmacological and optogenetic inhibitors of CaMKII have demonstrated that blocking CaMKII activity before LTP induction abolishes LTP, but inhibiting CaMKII after LTP induction does not reverse LTP, which is inconsistent with the autonomous CaMKII hypothesis of biochemical memory storage _(Buard et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2001; Malinow et al., 1989; Murakoshi et al., 2017; Otmakhov et al., 1997; Sanhueza et al., 2011), but also see (Sanhueza et al., 2007).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5573161/._ The relative significance of CaMKIIs T286 autophosphorylation, phosphorylation and binding of downstream target proteins, continues to be a subject of intense debate [REFERENCES]. Much of the uncertainty in interpreting studies that inhibit CaMKII enzymatic activity and its exact role in LTP arises from the fact that such inhibition also disrupts CaMKII's structural functions, particularly its binding to the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors. 

There is increasing evidence supporting a structural model in which LTP is maintained through the binding of CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit, independent of CaMKII's enzymatic activity [@sanhueza2011Role]. Very recently, there have been some key studies [REFERENCES] that focused on finding the minimal requirements for the ability of CaMKII to enhance synaptic transmission and its role in LTP maintenance. Although these studies were conducted independently, they both arrived at a similar conclusion: the role of T286 phosphorylation in CaMKII during LTP may not be primarily enzymatic. Instead, it may serve to enable and stabilize the CaMKII/GluN2B complex that is _essential_ for regulating synaptic CaMKII accumulation and supporting the associated structural functions of CaMKII required for LTP. In other words, T286 phosphorylation is involved in the initial signal processing that triggers LTP induction, enabling a downstream response via CaMKII's structural functions without requiring enzymatic activity. It is these structural functions of CaMKII that are, therefore, more likely to meet the essential and minimum molecular requirements for LTP induction and maintenance, though the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The CaMKII/NMDAR complex may enable activity-dependent CaMKII incorporation into postsynaptic sites, potentially acting as a structural seed to recruit postsynaptic density proteins, contributing to synapse restructuring and plasticity. 

Another well-known CaMKII substrate site is S831 (and, to a lesser extent, S845) on the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the AMPAR subunit GluA1. CaMKII phosphorylation of S831 in GluA1 increases AMPAR single-channel conductance, enhancing sodium ion flow into the postsynaptic neuron upon glutamate activation. This enhanced conductance of AMPARs can also result in a larger excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), which strengthens synaptic connections. The greater influx of sodium ions through phosphorylated AMPARs can lead to a more substantial depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. This depolarization can facilitate further calcium entry through NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which is critical for LTP induction as dicussed above. By increasing the activity and efficiency of AMPARs, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit can help stabilize synaptic changes over time. It is also proposed that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ CaMKII isoforms activation and their postsynaptic translocation induces the synaptic trapping of AMPARs diffusing in the membrane, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear [@diaz-alonsoLongterm; @opazo2010CaMKII; @patriarchi2018Postsynaptic; @hell2014CaMKII]. Notably, while CaMKII phosphorylation of GluA1 is important for mediating LTP mechanisms, strong evidence suggests that this may not be essential for LTP. LTP could still be observed _in vivo_ in knock-in mice lacking the CTD of GluA1 subunit in AMPA receptors. Additionally, LTP was also observed _in vitro_ when the GluA1 C-tail was transfected in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Instead, what may be necessary is a reserve pool of glutamate receptors independent of subunit type [@lee2010Specific; @diaz-alonsoLongterm; @granger2013LTP]. These findings further support the idea that the essential requirement for molecular LTP induction and maintenance may be the CaMKII/NMDAR interactions studied in this PhD. 

Ultimately, any structural LTP mechanism must regulate the filamentous (F)-actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, as changes in spine shape and size are closely linked to actin remodelling, which affects the strength of excitatory synaptic connections. During LTP induction, the balance between F-actin polymerization and degradation is transiently altered. Emerging evidence indicates that most signalling pathways linking synaptic activity to spine morphology modulate local actin dynamics.  Dendritic spine morphogenesis involves many actin-binding proteins and signaling pathways, which are beyond the scope of this project. However, our protein of interest, CaMKII, is situated upstream of the signalling pathway leading to F-actin modification [REFERENCES]. Notably, the $\beta$-CaMKII isoform has been shown to have direct structural roles in binding and bundling F-actin filaments [REFERENCES]. In its inactive, closed conformation, the $\beta$-CaMKII isoform is is bound to and crosslinked with F-actin filaments via the variable linker between the regulatory and association domains. This limits access of actin-regulating proteins to F-actin and stabilizes spine structure. Upon calcium influx through NMDARs after postsynaptic stimulation, after $\alpha$-CaMKII becomes autophosphorylayted, it can translocate from the PSD to interact with $\beta$-CaMKII, eventually leading to autophosphorylation of T287 in the latter isoform. This autophosphorylation releases $\beta$-CaMKII from F-actin, enabling actin remodelling via other actin regulators [REFERENCE]. Its subsequent reassociation stabilises the restructured F-actin for extended periods of time [REFERENCE]. Thus, the activity-dependent dissociation of $\beta$-CaMKII from F-actin may be of importace for actin dynamics remodelling that may allow dendritic spine plasticity and synaptic reorganization during LTP [REFERENCES]. It has been demonstrated that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ isoforms of CaMKII can directly interact with the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. However,  it is the $\alpha$ isoform, rather than the $\beta$, that is proposed to facilitate the activity-dependent incorporation of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex into postsynaptic sites [REFERENCES https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12873385/]. This process may act as a structural scaffold, recruiting postsynaptic density proteins and contributing to synaptic restructuring and plasticity. Consequently, these two primary neuronal isoforms appear to have distinct roles in neuronal plasticity, with $\alpha$ CaMKII regulating synaptic strength and $\beta$-CaMKII influencing dendritic morphology.

Alltogether, there is strong evidence showing CaMKII and NMDAR interactions play a critical role in maintaining LTP [REFERENCE], however, many questions remain unanswered. For example, how long does this complex last after LTP induction? (REFERENCES NEED TO LOOK THIS UP GOOD TO TEST). What is more, the precise mechanism of how CaMKII and NMDAR interactions form a complex is also hotly debated. A longstanding model posited that CaMKII binds to two distinct sites on the NMDAR C-terminal [REFERENCES]. However, recent crystal structure studies challenge this by suggesting that CaMKII substrates and activators interact at a single continuous site on the kinase domain [REFERENCE]. These findings underscore the importance of further research into the dynamics of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions. Gaining a clearer understanding of these interactions may shed light on the biochemical processes that stabilise memories and provide crucial insights into LTP and memory formation. Therefore, this PhD research of relevance and is well positioned to allow us to test the minimal requirements of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions while considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of CaMKII activity using computer models of these interactions.
