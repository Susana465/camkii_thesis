|Expected Result| Associated Reaction Rules | Observed in Models |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|
$\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binds to CaM in a stepwise manner, with higher affinity for forming CaM_Ca3 and CaM_Ca4 states. | Rules #1 - #4 (@fig-tbl-1)| No, see discussion.
|
CaMKII autophosphorylation at T286 is increased by binding to NMDARs and CaM. | Rules #5, #6, #8, #12 (@fig-tbl-1)| Yes, see Figure 6.6 and 6.8|
|
CaM binds CaMKII only in its fully saturated state (CaM_Ca4), stabilizing CaMKII in its open conformation. | Rule #6 (@fig-tbl-1) |  Not shown |
|
Open CaMKII binds to NMDARs, anchoring the kinase at the membrane .| Rule #12 (@fig-tbl-1) | Yes, see @fig-camkii-open |
|
CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation at T286 regardless of CaM binding, though this phosphorylation is enhanced by CaM binding.| Rule #8 (@fig-tbl-1)| Yes, see @fig-subsets-of-camkii-t286p-cam-binding | 
|
CaMKII is likely to undergo autophosphorylation at T306 following T286 phosphorylation, but T286 phosphorylation is not strictly required for T306 phosphorylation to occur. | Rules #8, #9 (@fig-tbl-1)| Yes, see @fig-t306p and @fig-t306p_anova|
|
CaMKII subunits can be found to be T306-phosphorylated and in a closed conformation. | Rules #5, #10 (@fig-tbl-1)| Yes, data not shown. |
