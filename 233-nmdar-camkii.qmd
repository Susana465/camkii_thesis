# CaMKII and NMDAR interactions to study memory

When studying learning and memory at the molecular level, in health and disease, it has been shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) together with their interactions with other proteins within neuronal spines, can influence their shape and size [@fink2002MolecularMechanismsCaMKII]. Long-term modifications of synaptic strength, such as LTD (Long Term Depression) and LTP (Long Term Potentiation) involve diverse chemical pathways and have been the primary mechanisms used to study the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008DissectingComponentsLongTerm]. So what exactly is happening at the cellular and molecular level during memory formation? In the sections below I give a more in depth answer to this question as well as how our molecules of interest work and why we are studying them.

## NMDARs structure and functions
The NMDAR is a glutamate receptor and ion channel found in neurons; it is an ionotropic glutamate receptor. Ionotropic channel proteins open to allow ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and/or Cl- pass through the membrane in response to the binding of a chemical messenger. NMDARs are permeable to Ca2+, Na+ and K+ ions and have a voltage dependent Mg2+ block. NMDARs, depending on the subunit composition, have glutamate and glycine as its ligands, the former being more common and the latter acting as a co-agonist. The binding of a ligand to NMDARs is typically not sufficient to open the channel and let ions through, as this is usually blocked by Mg2+ ions  (voltage block) which are only removed once the neuron is sufficiently depolarized. 

[INSERT FIGURE 4]

NMDARs are heterotetramers commonly composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. They can also be found in other conformations having GluN3 subunits. There are different subunit subtypes, for example GluN2 can be found as GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C or GluN2D, and we know there are GluN3A and 3B isoforms too [@ciabarra1995CloningCharacterizationChi1; @kvist2013StructurebasedDiscoveryAntagonists]. Depending on which subunits NMDARs exhibit, they will have slightly different properties and therefore different functions. There is even something called a “GluN2B-GluN2A developmental switch”, where GluN2B is predominantly present in the early postnatal brain, but switches to GluN2A during early development; eventually, GluN2A subunits become more numerous than GluN2B. These subtypes have different kinetics, and greater ratios of the GluN2B subunit leads to NMDA receptors which remain open longer compared to those with more GluN2A [@liu2004SwitchingNMDAReceptor]. This may, in part, account for greater memory abilities in the immediate postnatal period compared to late in life [@bar-shira2015GeneExpressionSwitching]. These findings were obtained from rats, killed in order to look at certain sections of their brains.

NMDARs can be expressed in neuroglia, non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system with a main objective of maintaining homeostasis and myelin formation [@fields2014GlialBiologyLearning]. However, its expression is mainly located to dendritic spines where, through subunit-specific interactions, it connects to intracellular molecules of the postsynaptic multi-protein network, or postsynaptic density area, known as the PSD. One of the proteins that interacts with NMDARs in the PSD is CaMKII, among many others which are not included in the description of this project but can be found extensively throughout publications [@volianskis2015LongtermPotentiationRole].

## CaMKII structure and functions

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II or CaMKII) is a serine/threonine-specific kinase, which means it’s a protein kinase enzyme that phosphorylates the OH group of amino acid residues serine or threonine. CaMKII accounts for up to 2 percent of all brain protein and is essential for memory formation [@erondu1985RegionalDistributionType; @lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction]. CaMKII is involved in many signalling cascades and is thought to be an important mediator of learning and memory. Depending on its component isoforms, CaMKII can also be found in cardiomyocytes for  Ca2+ homeostasis and reuptake [@swaminathan2012CalmodulinDependentProteinKinase], chloride transport in epithelia [@fahrmann2006FunctionalPartitioningEpithelial], positive T-cell selection [@mcgargill2005ActiveCa2Calmodulindependent], and cytotoxic T-cell activation. In this research we focus on CaMKII present in postsynaptic neurons which is relevant for memory formation. CaMKII functions are regulated through phosphorylation at multiple sites, and its localization within cells is directed by interactions with specific binding proteins.

The CaMKII holoenzyme is made up of twelve subunits [@bennett1983PurificationCharacterizationCalmodulindependent; @stratton2014ActivationtriggeredSubunitExchange; @bhattacharyya2016MolecularMechanismActivationtriggered; @rosenberg2005StructureAutoinhibitedKinase] arranged as two rings of six. Each CaMKII subunit features an N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal hub domain [@chao2011MechanismTunableAutoinhibition]. Each subunit has a hub domain, a kinase domain and a flexible regulatory domain which lends to the subunit a wide range of movement away from the holoenzyme’s central hub (@fig-camkii-subunit). @chao2011MechanismTunableAutoinhibition revealed the crystal structure of human alpha-CaMKII from E. coli, demonstrating its ability to transition between "docked" and "undocked" conformations. This dynamic process involves residues in the kinase domain's activation loop and a hub domain drive structure, likely hindering CaM binding to docked subunits, which affects the likelyhood of CaMKII activation. Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells, as per [@myers2017CaMKII], suggests that less than 3 percent of subunits adopt a compact conformation. This means most subunits are available for calmodulin to bind and consequently for CaMKII to remain in its active state, and the minority of subunits are in a state that is not activatable [47].

![CaMKII subunits shown as docked, undocked and open, closed.](23-memory-figures\subunit_docked_undocked.PNG){#fig-subunit-docked-undocked}

In addition to docking and undocking to the CaMKII central hub, each subunit can be in an “closed/inactive” conformation when the regulatory domain is bound to the kinase domain, or an “open/active” conformation when this binding is disrupted by thermodynamic effects. In the active conformation, the catalytic domain of a subunit is able to bind and phosphorylate enzymatic substrates. It has been suggested that a subunit may spontaneously return to an inactive conformation in the absence of Ca2+/CaM or phosphorylation at Thr-286 [@hoffman2011Conformational].

CaMKII’s functionality is defined by various sites within its domains. For example, an important site is the T286 site which allows attachment of a phosphate group. One subunit can be phosphorylated and then this can autophosphorylate neighbouring subunits, keeping CaMKII in an  autophosphorylated, extended state [@yang1999Structural; @chao2011MechanismTunableAutoinhibition].  Additionally, when CaMKII is in its undocked, open state, CaM can bind to the regulatory domain, enabling CaMKII to remain phosphorylated and activated for prolonged periods of time. LTP-induced association of CaMKII with the PSD can persist for at least 60 min after induction [@lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction]. The T286 site can be dephosphorylated by several synaptically localized protein phosphatases, such as PP1 [@shioda2017Physiological]. These characteristics make CaMKII a key role player in memory formation.

Activated CaMKII can phosphorylate various other synaptic proteins, initiating a cascade of reactions that alter synaptic strength. The extent of synaptic strength effects depends on the frequency of presynaptic action potentials (APs) and the presence of other regulatory modulators that can affect the synapse's sensitivity to plasticity changes.

## Bringing it all together: LTP, CaMKII/NMDAR complex as a molecular memory and interactions within the postsynaptic neuron

As described above, NMDA receptors are permeable to caclcium ions but their pore is blocked by Mg2+. This property gives important insight into how LTP is selectively induced by high frequency activity. During low frequency synaptic transmission, glutamate can be released and bind to NMDAR and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA receptors). Although glutamate can bind to both receptor types, if the postsynaptic neuron is at its normal resting membrane potential, the NMDAR channels will remain blocked by Mg2+ ions, preventing any current from flowing. In this situation, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will be fully mediated by AMPA receptors. Since the Mg2+ blockade of NMDARs is voltage-dependent, the synapse's function changes significantly when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized. High-frequency stimulation causes EPSPs to add up, leading to prolonged depolarization that removes Mg2+ from the NMDAR channel. This removal allows Ca2+ to enter the postsynaptic neuron, with the resulting calcium concentration increase in dendritic spines triggering LTP. The NMDAR acts as a molecular coincidence detector, opening its channel to induce LTP only when glutamate is bound and the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized to relieve the Mg2+ block.

A rise in intracellular calcium concentrations within the PSD then triggers a cascade of events, where Ca2+ activates a protein called calmodulin (CaM), and CaM can then allow CaMKII prolonged activation. The activation of CaMKII can allow for various mechanisms of LTP to proceed. CaMKII can interact with AMPAR and increase their sensitivity to further stimuli. Additionally, during early LTP, CaMKII has been shown to trigger diffusional trapping of surface AMPARs [@opazo2010CaMKII]. In the longer term, CaMKII can also signal for more receptors to become available in the postsynaptic membrane [@lisman2012MechanismsCaMKIIAction].

During these processes, CaMKII can bind to NMDARs, which increases CaMKII activity [@luscher2012NMDA], and determines what targets and modulators the kinase has access to thereby indirectly affecting kinase function. Neuronal CaMKII can affect synaptic plasticity in various ways. It can remain phosphorylated and active even after an initial stimulus to the neuron, which allows it to ‘react faster’ next time a stimulus is applied, leading to “molecular memory” [@sanhueza2013CaMKII]. CaMKII bound to actin filaments can also remodel the cytoskeleton and lead to dendritic spine growth through unbinding of CaMKII from the cytoskeleton’s actin filaments [@okamoto2007Role]. Therefore, these interactions can influence the shape and size of the dendritic spines, and trigger reaction cascades that ultimately lead to memory formation. 

We know that neurons’ spines change shape in response to LTP, and at the same time LTP leads to increased synaptic strength [@yuste2001Morphological]. CaMKII is involved in these processes; under low Ca2+ concentration, actin filaments are bundled by CaMKII. When the Ca2+ concentration is raised, CaMKII dissociates from actin and opens the window for actin remodelling. This remodelling ultimately leads to a change in the structure of the dendritic synapse [@wang2019Assemblies].

In chapter _REFERENCE_ I describe how I model some of these molecules to look into the dynamics and effects of CaMKII and NMDAR interactions during LTP in postsynaptic dendritic spines. 

## Specifics of CaMKII/NMDAR biochemical principles that underlie stable information storage by synapses

Notes to add somewhere.
CaMKII/NMDAR molecular switch requires prevention of spontaneous transitions from on/off states.

These two stabilize the off state:
Formation of CaMKII/NMDAR comples requires release of CaMKII from actin. High phosphorylation of CaMKII by Ca (doesn't this need Calmodulin as a prior step?).  

The stability of on state depends on intersubunit phosphorylation. Intersubunit autophosphorylation is also important for understanding why the on state stability is not compromised by protein turnover (what is protein turnover? - when there is subunit exchange in proteins i think).

Note: I am bypassing acting unbinding of CaMKII, how do I argue around this for this thesis?
