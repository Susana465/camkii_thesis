From EM immunolabeling data, we calculate that the PSD/cytoplasmic ratio is ~ 5%. A second independent estimate is derived from measurements indicating that the average mushroom spine PSD contains 90 to 240 holoenzymes.

Read this paper from 2022:
_Calcium–calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has remarkable properties and functions. When activated, CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation, thus rendering it active independent of the calcium–CaM complex (hereafter abbreviated as Ca2+–CaM), beyond the initial stimulation — endowing the kinase with a ‘molecular memory’1,2,3. In the hippocampus, CaMKII accounts for about 1–2% of total protein by mass and about 10% of protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD)4,5,6,7._ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2  (about 960 monomers per 0.1 μm2 of PSD),
