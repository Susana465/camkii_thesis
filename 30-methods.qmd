# Methods
**Abstract**
This chapter delves into the methods used to model molecular interactions of interest. Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell and CellBlender, I modeled the interactions of initial molecules released inside the cell, including Ca2+, CaM, CaMKII, PP1, and NMDARs on the cell surface. The binding dynamics of calcium to calmodulin and subsequent interactions with CaMKII ware examined, alongside the states of CaMKII (open/closed, active/inactive) and the phosphorylation processes of CaMKII. 

The results should highlight the importance of CaM binding to CaMKII, and NMDARs, and its regulation through phosphorylation, as well as the role of these interactions in maintaining the phosphorylated state of CaMKII within the postsynaptic density.

## Model validation

The processes used in software development can also apply to biological model development. Following @husar2022MCell4, four key points were considered for this project:

1.	Incremental model development: build the model step by step on validated foundations.

2.	Modularity: create self-contained, reusable libraries

3.	Unit testing and validation: ensure parts of the model behave as expected.

4.	Human-readable code: store using version control such as git for easy review by team members. 

What have pharris, ordyan and other people done and how does my model relate and differ.

## Model description

I have constructed the models at different scales to validate CaMKII interactions with other molecules like calmodulin and NMDARs, at increasing levels of complexity. First I re-created a model of CaMKII as a monomer that was previously completed in 2017. The model created uses cBNGL and represents CaMKII as monomers to serve as a proof of concept as well as a starting validation point, as dynamics of this model were previously shown to be within biologically accurate limits. Secondly, I created a model of CaMKII as a hexamer since modelling this molecule as a dodecamer gave rise to a combinatorial explosion due to the high number of possible states and the network of interactions generated. This is currently in the works of being resolved as I run the model using the network-free simulation using MCell. We will then be able to model CaMKII as a dodecamer. Finally, I aim to validate this work against a model from @ordyan2020Interactions, where they successfully modelled CaMKII as a twelve subunit holoenzyme using BioNetGen simulations. 

## Model parameters

## Model creation and visualization in CellBlender

I began the model of CaMKII monomers as described in the 2017 model I created using MCell and CellBlender. At the time, MCell did not allow for molecules be modelled as multi-complexes. Thus, for example, one phosphorylated CaMKII molecule in the model was just a single subunit phosphorylated –not twelve phosphorylated subunits. This model includes Ca2+ binding rates to CaM, CaM binding rates to monomeric CaMKII, and phosphorylation rates of active CaMKII monomers by one another, all depending on how many Ca2+ ions are bound to the CaM molecules involved. CaMKII dephosphorylation by PP1 is modelled, as well as binding interactions of CaMKII with NMDARs. In order to replicate and validate the results obtained from the CaMKII monomer in 2017, I re-wrote all reactions into a cBNGL model using the same parameters used originally. We define a volume previously modelled of 0.5μm3, which is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris and Stevens, 1989). Using cBNGL, I can specify the above mentioned 3D volume, with a 2D surface compartment acting as the cell membrane, where NMDARs can diffuse. Inside the cell volume, all of the interacting molecules are released as per table 1.


## How are these interactions modelled?
Initial molecules released inside the cell are: Ca2+, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Since four calcium ions are needed to fully saturate CaM (CaM_Ca4) [REFERENCES], five times more calcium than CaM and CaMKII was released to ensure it would not be a limiting factor [TABLE REFERENCE]. 


#### Binding of calcium to calmodulin
CaM can bind one, two, three, and four calcium ions progressively. 
In this model, the C terminal and N terminal binding sites of cam are not specified because we are not focusing on ca binding to cam. 

_Calmodulin comprises a 148aa residue polypeptide with four EF hands divided into C and N lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe [4]._ 

calmodulin lobes have been reported to differ in their kinetics and affinity for Ca2+:
- the N lobe binding faster with lower affinity and 
- the C lobe binding slower with higher affinity._ (Domas paper)

_An E–F hand consists of an N-terminal helix (the E helix) immediately followed by a centrally located, Ca2coordinating loop and a C-terminal helix (the F helix). The three-dimensional arrangement of these domains is reminiscent of the thumb, index and middle fingers of a hand, hence the name ‘E–F hand’._ [@chin2000Calmodulin]

Sensitivity tests for different parameters of ca binding to cam -> domas' suggestion model.

#### Binding of calmodulin to CaMKII
- Saturated CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII ring, T306 needs to be unphosphorylated
-> 5.1 CaMKII + CaM_Ca4 < - > CaMKII_CaM 
_In addition, CaMKII can be made insensitive to Ca2+/CaM by autophosphorylation at T305/T306 located within the Ca2+/CaM binding site [23],[24], a process that is facilitated by interaction with the membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK/CASK) [25],[26]. The balance between the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive and -insensitive CaMKII pool is critical for the regulation of post-synaptic plasticity [27],[28]._

_Moreover, Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII with unphosphorylated T306 effectively prevents phosphorylation of this residue [26]. These data are in agreement with our co-crystal structure that showed that both threonine residues (T306/T307) were deeply buried within the Ca2+/CaM complex (Figure 4B)._

_Human CaMKII kinase domains bound Ca2+/CaM with affinities between 1.6 and 3.4×106 Mol−1 (KD: 0.6–0.3 µM)_

The microscopic kon for CaM binding to CaMKII has been measured, using a 215 CaMKII peptide and fluorescently labeled DA-CaM, as 1 × 108 M-1s-1 [50].(Pharris et al.,).

CaM only binds at high affinity to CaMKII, skipping binding at "initially bound", closed CaMKII. 
Can CaM bind if CaMKII is closed? - what do studies say.
CaM can bind to CaMKII even if the former is not fully saturated with calcium, but not in our model. 

## CaM-trapping and how we model it


#### States of CaMKII
CaMKII functions are controlled through phosphorylation at multiple sites, and molecules localization within cells is directed by interactions with specific binding proteins.

open/closed, active/inactive, docked/undocked.

Active~1 means a subunit is undocked and open.
CaM can only bind if subunit is active.
Pharris is modelling undocked, closed state; but I am modelling flickering directly from docked/closed to undocked/open. Skipping the middle step. 

I am only modelling high affinity binding of cam to camkii.

Can CaMKII close/become inactive if it's phosphorylated?
Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells, as per @myers2017CaMKII, suggests that less than 3 percent of subunits adopt a compact conformation (Figure 6).

#### Phosphorylation of CaMKII

Modelling studies (Lisman, 1985; Miller et al., 2005) have suggested that intersubunit autophosphorylation can maintain the phosphorylated state of the kinase once it is located in the PSD; each subunit is catalytic and, if itself phosphorylated at T286, can phosphorylate T286 on a nearby subunit that might become dephosphorylated (this reaction requires that the substrate subunit has calmodulin bound as a result of basal Ca2+ levels (Hanson et al., 1994)). Recent reconstitution experiments directly demonstrate this mechanism (Urakubo et al., 2014).

 CaMKII phosphorylation
# When CaMKII_CaM, neighbouring subunit, if bound to CaM, can P
	CaMKII(l!1,T286~0,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,cam!+) -> CaMKII(l!1,T286~P,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,cam!+) k_pCaM4
# When CaMKII_CaM_P, can phosphorylate neighbouring subunit
  	CaMKII(l!1,T286~0,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,T286~P) -> CaMKII(l!1,T286~P,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,T286~P) k_pCaM4_P	

(Rostas and Skelding, 2023)_Initial enzyme activity of purified CaMKII requires the binding of both calcium and calmodulin. Following this, autophosphorylation of Thr286 in CaMKIIα occurs quickly and produces the following outcomes:_

- A 1000-fold increase in the affinity for CaM_Ca4
So when CaMKII_P binding of CaM_Ca4 is 1000 times more likely to bind (and stay bound) to CaMKII_P. 
This should mean that CaM_Ca4 dissociation rate from CaMKII_P should be quite slow.
-> how do I model this?/is it already modelled in the reactions I have?
Right now:
CaM(ca~4,camkii) + CaMKII(cam,T306~0,active~1) <-> CaM(ca~4,camkii!1).CaMKII(cam!1,T306~0,active~1) kon_cam_ca4_camkii, koff_cam_ca4_camkii

Which means that CaM can bind to CaMKII regardless of whether T286 is phosphorylated or not. 

Pharris et al., also do a detransition of different steps for dephosphorylation. In this model we have the requirement that cam be not bound to a camkii subunit but otherwise PP1 can act and dephosorylate directly (we don't have a step for binding of pp1, then dephosphorylation
)

_Autophosphorylation unmasks a phenylalanine (F) and a glutamine (N) in the CaM-binding domain (shown in red), enabling a large increase in the affinity of Ca2+/CaM, known as CaM-trapping._

#### Binding of CaMKII to NMDARs
Which part of CaMKII binds to NMDAR? Is there overlap of cam binding to camkii vs nmdar/camkii binding? There no overlap, cam can bind to camkii even if this is bound to nmdars. 

Autophosphorylation of Thr286 allows CaMKII to bind to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor [85,94]. 

CaMKII bound to GluN2B induces a conformational change in CaMKII, which allows CaMKII to maintain its autonomous activity even if CaMKII is dephosphorylated at Thr286. Even if calmodulin dissociates following a drop in intracellular calcium levels, CaMKII can remain active (have autonomous activity without calcium/cam).

Phosphorylation of Thr305/306 that would occur in autonomously active CaMKII is inhibited when CaMKII is bound to GluN2B. This allows CaMKII bound to GluN2B to bind cam_ca4 again following a subsequent increase in intracellular calcium concentrations.

Competitive actions of DAPK1 in LTD - for future work? or can I add to model?

# What have other people done?
_Previous multi-state models of CaMKII exist but are different in focus and in scope from the 462 present model. For example, our model is based on an earlier multi-state model by Stefan et al. (2012) 463 [29] implemented in the particle-based stochastic simulator StochSim [70].StochSim does not explicitly account for spatial information. MCell, as a spatial simulator, 466 offers more possibilities to precisely account for spatial effects and to situate models in spatially realistic 467 representations of cellular compartments. In addition, the model by Stefan et al. provides only for 468 interactions between adjacent CaMKII molecules on the same hexamer ring and therefore models 469 CaMKII as a hexamer, not a dodecamer._

Michalski and 470 Loew (2012) bionetgen and vcell.

rule-based model of the CaMKII holoenzyme by 478 Li and Holmes [26] offers a detailed representation of how CaM binds to Ca2+ and subsequently activates 479 CaMKII subunits, based on earlier results of CaM regulation [75]. Li and Holmes offer valuable and 480 detailed insight into how CaM binding to CaMKII depends on Ca2+ dynamics.

Parris model looks at CaMKII dynamics with CaM particularly, uses mcell - they didnt look at binding with nmdars. This study was done using MCell 3.3 which did not allow for diffusion of multistate molecules. 

Ordyan looks at CaMKII and NMDARs with mcell and bionetgen but does not look at space dynamics - I think? 
Ordyan et al., use rule-based modelling methodology using Monte Carlo methods similar to this work, to investigate how Ca2+ signals influence the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation within the PSD.

_Ordyan et al. (199) developed a multiscale, rule-based model of CaMKII activation that accounted for kinetics of CaMKII modelled as a monomer and a holoenzyme. Their findings suggested that CaMKII functions as a leaky integrator of Ca2+ pulses in the presence of neurogranin (Ng) and PP1, consistent with previous experimental observations in short LTP (46). Their results suggest CaMKII integrates Ca2+ signals in a frequency-dependent manner, which contrasts with the earlier models that propose CaMKII functions as a bistable memory switch (212)._

Likewise, another model supports the idea that CaMKII acts as a leaky integrator of Ca2+ in a PP1-rich environment (243). Rather, CaMKII might exhibit bistability in specific microenvironments, such as the 'core' PSD where it binds to the NMDA receptor (Dosemeci et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2003). Whereas in the spine cytosol, CaMKII has been demonstrated to act not as a bistable switch but as a leaky integrator of calcium activity (Chang et al., 2017).

## Bartol et al., 2024
Bartol et al. 2024 use particle-based stochastic simulations in MCell4 to model the activation of CaMKII by Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs within a postsynaptic spine. They translate the kinetic properties of CaMKII regulation previously measured _in vitro_ into the context of a computational model of a postsynaptic spine.

Using MCell4 simulations, the paper shows that CaMKII autophosphorylation, influenced by 'Ca2+-calmodulin-trapping' and PP1 dephosphorylation mechanisms, does not behave as a bistable switch, but instead they propose a "kinetic proofreading" mechanism of CaMKII, crucial for synaptic plasticity induction.

They test CaM trapping hypothesis that it leads to an increase in CaMKII autoP during high frequency synaptic stimulation. They _test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of CaM-trapping on the dynamics of activation of CaMKII in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model instantiated in a realistic spine geometry_. _We also investigate how CaM-trapping may regulate dephosphorylation of CaMKII by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), and thus influence the kinetics of autophosphorylation of CaMKII and the response of CaMKII to different stimulation frequencies._
