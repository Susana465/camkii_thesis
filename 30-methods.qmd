# Methods
Abstract

This chapter delves into the methods used to model molecular interactions of interest. Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell and CellBlender, I modeled the interactions of initial molecules released inside the cell, including Ca2+, CaM, CaMKII, PP1, and NMDARs on the cell surface. The binding dynamics of calcium to calmodulin and subsequent interactions with CaMKII ware examined, alongside the states of CaMKII (open/closed, active/inactive) and the phosphorylation processes of CaMKII. 

The results should highlight the importance of CaM binding to CaMKII, and NMDARs, and its regulation through phosphorylation, as well as the role of these interactions in maintaining the phosphorylated state of CaMKII within the postsynaptic density.

## What I want out of this chapter?
Explain CaMKII and NMDARs interactions in detail. Explain how they are structurally interacting, what bonds are binding, and what specific molecules are being attracted or repulsed in each molecule.

DO NOT GET SIDE TRACKED WITH OTHER CHAPTERS. IF IDEAS COME CAN WRITE BUT FOCUS IS ON METHODS (do I want to rewrite this during the writing week? this probably takes quite a big chunk of time, decide on week have this as a maybe), BIOLOGY OF CAMKII AND NMDARS, AND RESULTS. 
I want to specify what happens to CaMKII when its docked, open etc in all the different steps and what this means in terms of conditions of binding etc. What are the assumptions and what are the real conditions for camkii to P or be active, for exmaple?

During the writing retreat, I want to:
- read and specify in writing what happens when camkii docked vs undocked
- tidy up all the info I have already below on CaMKII and NMDARs into a cohesive story
- Tidy up the section where I write what others have done and why mine is different
- Look at the feedback David game a few weeks ago on thesis layout (need to find)
- Add result figures (add at least 4) of molecule reactions

Further objectives I'd like to add here are:
- finish model and see what different conditions I can test, mutants vs wt for example
- look at space dynamics in mcell, need to discuss with supervisors

## Model description and molecular species: How are molecular interactions modelled?

I have constructed the models at different scales to validate CaMKII interactions with other molecules like calmodulin and NMDARs, at increasing levels of complexity. First I re-created a model of CaMKII as a monomer that was previously completed in 2017. That model used cBNGL and represented CaMKII as monomers to serve as a proof of concept as well as a starting validation point, as dynamics of this model were previously shown to be within biologically accurate limits. Secondly, I created a model of CaMKII as a hexamer since modelling this molecule as a dodecamer with only BNGL gave rise to combinatorial explosion due to the high number of possible states and the network of interactions generated. This was resolved running network-free simulations using MCell. The final model, and the one we will be focusing on, is ran with CaMKII as a dodecameric molecule. The model contains four protein species: CaM, PP1, CaMKII and NMDARS (see table of molecules included in the model). Initial molecules released inside the cell are: Ca2+ ions, CaM, CaMKII and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Since four calcium ions are needed to fully saturate CaM (CaM_Ca4) [REFERENCES], five times more calcium than CaM and CaMKII was released to ensure it would not be a limiting factor [TABLE REFERENCE]. Interactions between different molecules are modelled as rules in BNGL (as explained in CHAPTER REFERENCE), where each molecule reacts according to certain conditions and kinetic rates.  

There are different ways in which molecular states can happen and interact. For example, CaMKII subunits can flicker, without external prompt of any other molecule, between an open and closed state (reaction #5 @fig-table-rxns1). Likewise, if two neighbouring subunits are open, one can autophosphorylate the other (reaction #7 @fig-table-rxns1). If calmodulin then binds to a subunit that is phosphorylated, it is more likely to keep the subunit in an active, phosphorylated state. In contrast, phosphorylation of the T306 site prevents calmodulin from binding to the CaMKII subunit (reaction #8 @fig-table-rxns1), making the subunit less likely to remain in its active state compared to when it is stabilized by CaM binding or T286 phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation by PP1 at T286 can occur when the site is accessible, meaning the subunit is phosphorylated at T286, unbound to CaM, and in an open state. In order to fully understand the different conditions and reactions in the model, let's look into them more in detail next.

### Modelling CaMKII as a dodecamer

Molecules in the model can have various binding sites, or none. For example, Ca2+ and PP1 are modelled as reactants that can interact with other molecules, but they themselves don't have binding sites. On the other hand, CaM, CaMKII and NMDAR all have different binding sites (ADD FIGURE). Importantly, CaMKII is modelled as a dodecamer, with two rings of six subunits stacked on top of each other (ADD FIGURE). Each subunit is modelled to have the following possible states:

- A calmodulin binding site, calmodulin can be bound or unbound
- A NMDAR binding site, CaMKII can be bound or unbound to NMDARs
- A T286 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated or phosphorylated,
- A T306 phosphorylation site, which can be unphosphorylated or phosphorylated,
- A status of being open (active) or closed (inactive). 

An inactive subunit lacks catalytic activity because its regulatory domain is bound to its catalytic site (closed). In contrast, an active subunit has catalytic activity because the kinase domain is not inhibited structrually, the subunit is thus open when its active. In our model, CaMKII subunits are modelled with autonomous activation, where subunits can flicker between an open and closed state if they are unbound to CaM and unphosphorylated at T286, as CaM binding and T286 phosphorylation structurally impede closing. States of other binding sites and phosphorylation sites can vary. In our model, CaM can only bind to a high affinity binding site, if the subunit is in an open state. 

Can CaMKII close or become inactive if it is phosphorylated? Yes -> see t305/6 phosphorylation actions below. 

Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells, as per @myers2017CaMKII, suggests that less than 3 percent of subunits adopt a compact conformation (Figure 6).

### Binding of calcium to calmodulin
CaM is modelled as being able to bind four calcium ions; CaM has four EF hands divided into N and C lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe. The N lobe binds calcium faster with lower affinity and the C lobe binds slower with higher affinity [REFERENCES]. Numerous models have been developed to investigate the dynamics of calcium binding to CaM [REFERENCES]. Linkevicius et al. (2024) examined and compared various of these models, providing a useful summary of the typical categories for modeling CaM binding to Ca2+. The model used here falls under their proposed "scheme 3" (@fig-scheme3-cam), where calcium binds and unbinds to four separate calcium binding sites in calmodulin. Unlike other models that distinguish between CaM's N-terminal and C-terminal binding lobes, this project does not, as the specifics of calcium binding to calmodulin are beyond its scope. Additionally, following "scheme 3" approach to calcium binding produces biologically relevant results while avoiding complexity, allowing us to focus on further CaMKII and NMDARs interactions.

![We model calcium binding to calmodulin following "scheme 3" proposed by Linkevicius et al., 2024. It is a sequential calmodulin scheme where each binding site is represented individually. Figure modified from Linkevicius et al., 2024.](30-methods-figures\scheme3_cam.PNG){#fig-scheme3-cam}

### Binding of calmodulin to CaMKII
Calmodulin bound to different amounts of calcium has been shown to bind to CaMKII with different affinities, with calmodulin bound to four calcium having the highest affinity [REFERENCE]. In this model, for simplicity, we therefore assume that apo-CaM has negligible affinity for CaMKII, and only fully saturated CaM with four calciums binds to open CaMKII subunits. Additionally, CaM binds to a CaMKII subunit only if T306 is dephosphorylated. The T305/T306 site lies within the CaM binding region. It has been shown that autophosphorylation at T305/T306 makes CaMKII impedes CaM binding, and similarly CaM binding prevents T306 phosphorylation [26] [@rellos2010Structure]. In the model here, CaM is able to bind to CaMKII with the following rules:

- CaM must be fully saturated (bound to four calcium ions), i.e. only CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII. We assume only one high affinity binding site for CaM in each CaMKII subunit.
- CaMKII subunit must be in its open/active state.
- T306 must be unphosphorylated.

It has been suggested that there are both low- and high-affinity binding sites for calmodulin within the regulatory domain of a CaMKII subunit [REFERENCES]. While CaM binding to the low-affinity site is compatible with CaMKII remaining in a closed state, binding to the high-affinity site is thought to structurally prevent CaMKII from closing (Stefan et al., 2012, MORE REFERENCES). If CaM initially binds to the low-affinity site while the kinase is inactive/closed, it might "slide" along residues 291-312 to the higher-affinity site, thereby shifting the CaMKII subunit into its open/active state (need REFERENCE?). Once bound to this high-affinity site, CaM prevents the subunit from returning to its closed state, maintaining its active conformation.

Stefan et al., 2012 predicted that calmodulin binding in itself was not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of calmodulin is. Likely due to the stabilising effect of high affinity binding of CaM to CaMKII structurally keeping the kinase in its active state. Additionally, T286 phosphorylation has been shown to also stabilise CaMKII in an active state, therefore making the high-affinity binding site accessible [REFERENCE]. 

In fact, stochastic simulations of a biochemical model showed that two such binding sites, with only one of them accessible in the active, open conformation, could be sufficient to explain calmodulin trapping by CaMKII [reference from stefan et al., 2012]. In the model used in this PhD project, I propose that CaM can remain bound and in a "trapped" position without modelling the low affinity binding site. CaM-trapping happens as CaM binding affinity increases with CaMKII subunit phosphorylation at T286 (REFERENCE), and CaM therefore remains bound to CaMKII subunits for longer. In a dynamic interplay, as autophosphorylation promoted CaM trapping, CaM trapping has also been proposed to lead to an enhanced, non-linear increase in autophosphorylation of CaMKII during high-frequency synaptic stimulations (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998; Nicoll and Schulman, 2023; Putney, 1998).

The literature often describes CaM binding as activating CaMKII. However, this may not always be the case. When a CaMKII subunit spontaneously flickers into its active/open state CaM binding is likely to stabilize the subunit once it is already active, but not to initiate activation. Similarly, while it is commonly suggested that simultaneous binding of CaM to two neighboring subunits triggers T286 autophosphorylation, we propose that CaM's role might be more nuanced. Instead of being essential for T286 phosphorylation, CaM may stabilize the open state of CaMKII, thereby increasing the likelihood of phosphorylation. 

(I feel like this is repetitive but leaving for now) While the ultimate effect remains the same —CaM binding increases CaMKII activity— there is a subtle distinction between CaM directly inducing activity and phosphorylation of CaMKII, versus CaM stabilizing the active/open state, thus facilitating phosphorylation. Moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated CaMKII autophosphorylation can be sustained even after CaM levels decrease [REFERNECE], adding to the argument that CaM is not necessary for autophosphorylation, but rather an indirect enhancer of it. Since CaM's affinity for CaMKII increases following phosphorylation, it is plausible that CaM remains bound to phosphorylated subunits, further stabilizing their active state and facilitating continued phosphorylation. Thus, CaM binding may not be strictly necessary for autophosphorylation but rather enhances the probability of phosphorylation by maintaining subunits in their active/open states.

### CaMKII activity, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation

The most extensively studied phosphorylation sites on CaMKII are Thr286 and Thr305/Thr306 as they have been shown to be key for CaMKII activity regulation. Likewise, in this study, we focus on these two sites. While other phosphorylation sites on CaMKII have been identified, their functions are not yet fully understood. 

First, let's look at phosphorylation of the T286 site. Phosphorylation of T286 can happen if two adjascent subunits are in their open states, through a process known as autophosphorylation. CaMKII subunits need to be open so that the ATP binding site is available for the gamma-phosphate of ATP to be transferred to the hydroxyl group of the threonine residue at T286. The open state of two neighbouring subunits is crucial for the catalytic site of one subunit to reach and phosphorylate its neighboring subunit. 

In our model, we assume ATP molecule levels are sufficient to ensure the reaction proceeds at its maximal rate (saturating), so we do not model ATP as a reactant but rather focus on the phosphorylation process under these conditions. Furthermore, we do not make it a requirement for CaM to be bound to neighbouring subunits for phosphorylation to happen, as this is not certain and remains to be proven. There is evidence for CaM binding and further CaM trapping that suggests CaM binding is likely to increase the probability of CaMKII phosphorylation, but this does not strictly mean it is required for phosphorylation to happen. 

To test whether CaM binding is truly required for CaMKII phosphorylation, we could create a mutant of CaMKII that remains in an open, active state without the need for CaM. If this mutant shows high levels of phosphorylation even in the absence of CaM, it would suggest that CaM binding is not structurally necessary for phosphorylation; rather, what’s essential is that CaMKII remains in an active conformation. However, if phosphorylation levels remain low without CaM, it would indicate that CaM binding is indeed required, possibly because it facilitates or stabilizes the open conformation necessary for the kinase to function.

What is clear is that autophosphorylation at T286 and CaM binding are in a constant back and forth dance, both events feedforward each other leading to finetuned regulation of CaMKII activity. Autophosphorylation at this site unmasks a phenylalanine (F) and a glutamine (N) in the CaM-binding domain, which has been shown to increase affinity of CaM between 10-fold and 1000-fold [REFERENCES]. This increase in CaM binding has been labelled CaM-trapping; this trapping then may allow for further autophosphorylation of CaMKII. Autophosphorylation enables kinase activity to persist after CaM dissociates from CaMKII [REFEREnces]. 



(This manuscript reports the fundamental finding that an oligomeric protein kinase, CaMKII, can be phosphorylated by another molecule of the holoenzyme in a manner that does not involve subunit exchange. the summary by editor and abstract say different things. the abstract says inter subunit exchange, the summary says intra subunit exxchange which one is it.  https://elifesciences.org/articles/86090 )

Is the info below wrong, then? 
Modelling studies (Lisman, 1985; Miller et al., 2005) have suggested that intersubunit autophosphorylation can maintain the phosphorylated state of the kinase once it is located in the PSD; each subunit is catalytic and, if itself phosphorylated at T286, can phosphorylate T286 on a nearby subunit that might become dephosphorylated.
(this reaction requires that the substrate subunit has calmodulin bound as a result of basal Ca2+ levels (Hanson et al., 1994)). 
Recent reconstitution experiments directly demonstrate this mechanism (Urakubo et al., 2014).
_It has been reported that the binding affinity of CaMKIIα for Ca2+/CaM increases by Thr286 phosphorylation [7]._ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10694-z

(Rostas and Skelding, 2023)_Initial enzyme activity of purified CaMKII requires the binding of both calcium and calmodulin. Following this, autophosphorylation of Thr286 in CaMKIIα occurs quickly and produces the following outcomes:_

- A 1000-fold increase in the affinity for CaM_Ca4
So when CaMKII_P binding of CaM_Ca4 is 1000 times more likely to bind (and stay bound) to CaMKII_P. 

This should mean that CaM_Ca4 dissociation rate from CaMKII_P should be quite slow.

the active cam bound kinetics of camkii will be different to the active cam unbound kinetics. so i think this should be specified in the model. 

right now after conversations with melanie we decided to just add active~1 no matter whether its bound to cam nmdar or just open, but the reactions kinetics will vary depending on whether camkii is active~1 because of flickering, cam bound or nmdar bound. I think? need to look into literature and maybe this can be a hypothesis to test. 

would camkii activity make a difference if camkii active~1 varies due to being bound to nmdars or cam?

but how do i make it into a hypothesis without biting my own tail? as in, i add x or y kinetics, of course its gonna give x or y results respectively. there are also emergent properties. 

Pharris et al., do a detransition of different steps for dephosphorylation. In this model we have the requirement that cam be not bound to a camkii subunit but otherwise PP1 can act and dephosorylate directly (we don't have a step for binding of pp1, then dephosphorylation
)


It is well established that each subunit within the 12meric CaMKII holoenzyme is activated separately by direct binding of Ca2+/CaM [for review, see (16)]. However, when Ca2+/CaM binds to two neighboring subunits, it additionally induces a fast trans-subunit autophosphorylation at T286 (46, 47), which generates autonomous kinase activity that outlasts the initial Ca2+ stimulus. Then, dissociation of Ca2+/CaM exposes T305/306 for phosphorylation by the autonomous CaMKII. 

from paper-> our results indicate that pT286 and Ca2+/CaM may not substantially differ in the degree of opening the inhibitory gate that is provided by the regulatory domain. Instead, pT305/306 actively contributes to some level of direct inhibition, independently from preventing Ca2+/CaM binding. 
The trans-pT305/306 reaction requires previous pT286 on the neighboring subunit that acts as the kinase but then leads also to a feed-forward inhibition of subsequent pT286 on these pT305/306-only subunits. 

The trans-pT305/306 reaction requires previous pT286 on the neighboring subunit that acts as the kinase but then leads also to a feed-forward inhibition of subsequent pT286 on these pT305/306-only subunits. Together, these mechanisms enable a wide array of finely tuned possible states for each CaMKII holoenzyme, with each state tightly linked to the inducing Ca2+ stimulus. 

For instance, for a trans-pT305/306 to completely shut down a kinase subunit, the Ca2+ stimulus must be sufficiently high to induce some pT286 within the holoenzyme (which requires Ca2+/CaM binding to two neighboring subunits) but sufficiently low to not induce pT286 on all of the neighboring subunits.

T305/306 phosphorylation

 We first introduced phospho-mimic mutations of inhibitory autophosphorylation sites (T305D/T306D) to inhibit the interaction of CaM to the regulatory domain of CaMKIIα2,15. We found that the mutation largely inhibited the rapid CaM binding, consistent with the previous reports15. 
this phosphorylation is associated with autoinhibition of CaMKII. This phosphorylation stabilizes the interaction between the regulatory domain and the catalytic domain, locking CaMKII in an inactive state, preventing calmodulin binding. 

Lucic et al., 2008 -> Detailed state model of CaMKII activation and autophosphorylation

We cannot exclude the
possibility that the exact amount of T305 phosphorylated
CaMKII was determined inaccurately because the
Eur Biophys J (2008) 38:83–98 87
123
anti-phospho T286 CaMKII antibody has different affinity
for T305 phosphorylated aCaMKII. However, this would
not change the outcome of our simulations because, as we
show below, that autophosphorylation at T305 does not
significantly affect the autophosphorylation at T286 under
our experimental conditions.

This is an intra-subunit phosphorylation that reduces the catalytic activity of CaMKII-> (Hashimoto et al. 1987; Lou and Schulman 1989). It can occur after CaM dissociates from a T286 autophosphorylated subunit, and it prevents the rebinding of CaM
(Hashimoto et al. 1987; Patton et al. 1990).

slower CaMKII autophosphorylation at T305/306 inhibits stimulation by Ca2+/CaM, but occurs only minimally for CaMKII wild type during CaM-stimulated activity assays. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037176 
-> _Previous studies that used the effect on stimulated CaMKII activity as a readout indicated similar rates for the T305/T306 burst phosphorylation (∼0.01–0.05 sec−1, based on the time observed for half-maximal kinase inhibition) [37], [39], [40],_

Another physiologically relevant phosphorylation site is
T305/306 at aCaMKII (T306/307 at bCaMKII, both
denoted as T305 phosphorylation) (Hashimoto et al. 1987;
Lou and Schulman 1989). This is an intra-subunit phosphorylation that reduces the catalytic activity of CaMKII
(Hashimoto et al. 1987; Lou and Schulman 1989). It can
occur after CaM dissociates from a T286 autophosphorylated subunit, and it prevents the rebinding of CaM
(Hashimoto et al. 1987; Patton et al. 1990) @lucic2008Detailed

biological importance proposal:
(My own thoughts) This stabilization mechanism may act as a form of kinetic proofreading by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive or less active unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. It prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling in response to synaptic activity.

Finding about t305/306 phosphorylation _in vitro_ transgenic mice @pi2010Autonomous (in presence of cam)
- T286D mutant: autonomous CaMKII that are constitutively active and do not require calcium/calmodulin binding for activation.

Contrary to initial expectations where T286D CaMKII was thought to only potentiate synaptic strength (mimicking LTP), the researchers found that depending on the phosphorylation status at Thr305/306, T286D CaMKII could also induce synaptic depression (mimicking LTD).

T286D/T305D/T306D (pseudophosphorylated form): Led to synaptic depression (LTD-like process).
T286D/T305A/T306A (form where T305/T306 cannot be phosphorylated - this would mean camkii is not regulated back into autoinhibited state through T305 phosphorylation): Prevented LTD and instead promotes potentiation (LTP-like effect).

t305/306 phosphorylation as also been shown to prevent camkii's activity-dependent translocation to the postsynaptic density. so if camkii is not phosphorylated at t305/306, it may translocate to PSD, but if this site is phosphorylated, translocation will be reduced - which fits in with the idea that t305/306 once again is like a "dimmer switch"

Two main notes from Susana
- Okay so we know that t305 phosphorylation structutrally impedes/reduces affinity of cam binding (which are not the same thing but have relatively similar outcomes of cam binding less to camkii)

- but also, phosphorylation at the t305 site - does it render camkii in an inactive, autonibited state, or can camkii that is p at t305 remain active? need to find this in lterature. yes, it is likely it reduces camkii activity as it renders each subunit into the closed, inactive, autoinhibited state. 


#### Binding of CaMKII to NMDARs
Which part of CaMKII binds to NMDAR? Is there overlap of cam binding to camkii vs nmdar/camkii binding? There is no overlap, cam can bind to camkii even if this is bound to nmdars. 

CaMKII kinase domain binds to NMDARs. The kinase domain in CaMKII is responsible for the enzyme's kinase activity, which includes binding ATP and transferring a phosphate group to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, such as S1303 on the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. 

Activation of the kinase domain typically involves relief of autoinhibition, often through binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM).

To realize such a memory switch at synapses, the interaction between CaMKII and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit GluN2B has been shown to be critically important. The interaction between CaMKII and GluN2B is required for persistent activation and translocation of CaMKII (8,9), persistent T286 phosphorylation (10), and LTP maintenance (11,12). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985500/

CaMKII directly interacts with GluN2B which anchors CaMKII at the synapse in an
active conformation (Bayer et al., 2001). Targeting CaMKII to the PSD via its interaction
with GluN2B is critical for the phosphorylation of GluA1 subunits of the AMPA receptor
among many other PSD proteins (Lisman et al., 2002; Barria and Malinow, 2005; Zhou et al.,
2007). 

CaMKII directly binds both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits via binding sites located in
the CTDs of the receptor subunits (Bayer et al., 2001, 2006; Gardoni et al., 1999; Leonard et al., 1999;
Strack et al., 2000); however, it has a greater affinity for GluN2B (Strack and Colbran, 1998). 

Two CaMKII-binding sites have been identified in the GluN2B subunit at residues 839–1120 and 1290–1310 (Strack and
Colbran, 1998; Leonard et al., 1999; Strack et al., 2000; Bayer et al., 2001) @kellermayer2018Superresolution

Transient CaMKII activity evokes an initial reversible, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent binding of GluN2B
to the substrate-binding site within the catalytic domain of CaMKII, whereas prolonged
enzymatic activity leads to a persistent interaction between GluN2B and the Thr286-binding
site of CaMKII, locking CaMKII in an active conformation, as mentioned above

Autophosphorylation of Thr286 allows CaMKII to bind to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor [85,94]. 

CaMKII bound to GluN2B induces a conformational change in CaMKII, which allows CaMKII to maintain its autonomous activity even if CaMKII is dephosphorylated at Thr286. Even if calmodulin dissociates following a drop in intracellular calcium levels, CaMKII can remain active (have autonomous activity without calcium/cam).

Phosphorylation of Thr305/306 that would occur in autonomously active CaMKII is inhibited when CaMKII is bound to GluN2B -> need to find reference as to how this happens. probably because the binding keeps the kinase domain from closing into the autoinhibitory domain. 

This allows CaMKII bound to GluN2B to bind cam_ca4 again following a subsequent increase in intracellular calcium concentrations.

CaMKII bound to GluN2B Subunit Exhibits Increased ATP Affinity and Attenuated Dephosphorylation @cheriyan2011Calcium

Competitive actions of DAPK1 in LTD - for future work? or can I add to model?

T305/306 phosphorylation directly reduces binding to GluN2B
CaMKII binding to GluN2B participates in enhancing synaptic strength (26, 27), consistent with our findings with the CaMKII I205K mutant (Fig. 2A). Thus, we decided to test the effects of T305/306 phosphorylation on CaMKII/GluN2B interaction. T305/306 phosphorylation had been suggested to reduce CaMKII binding to GluN2B (29); however, these experiments did not differentiate between a direct effect of the phosphorylation and an indirect effect via reduced Ca2+/CaM binding. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101658/

## Model validation

The processes used in software development can also apply to biological model development. Following @husar2022MCell4, four key points were considered for this project:

1.	Incremental model development: build the model step by step on validated foundations.

2.	Modularity: create self-contained, reusable libraries

3.	Unit testing and validation: ensure parts of the model behave as expected.

4.	Human-readable code: store using version control such as git for easy review by team members. 

Finally, I aim to validate this work against a model from @ordyan2020Interactions, where they successfully modelled CaMKII as a twelve subunit holoenzyme using BioNetGen simulations. 
What have pharris, ordyan and other people done and how does my model relate and differ.

## Model creation and visualization in CellBlender

I began the model of CaMKII monomers as described in the 2017 model I created using MCell and CellBlender. At the time, MCell did not allow for molecules be modelled as multi-complexes. Thus, for example, one phosphorylated CaMKII molecule in the model was just a single subunit phosphorylated –not twelve phosphorylated subunits. This model includes Ca2+ binding rates to CaM, CaM binding rates to monomeric CaMKII, and phosphorylation rates of active CaMKII monomers by one another, all depending on how many Ca2+ ions are bound to the CaM molecules involved. CaMKII dephosphorylation by PP1 is modelled, as well as binding interactions of CaMKII with NMDARs. In order to replicate and validate the results obtained from the CaMKII monomer in 2017, I re-wrote all reactions into a cBNGL model using the same parameters used originally. We define a volume previously modelled of 0.5μm3, which is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris and Stevens, 1989). Using cBNGL, I can specify the above mentioned 3D volume, with a 2D surface compartment acting as the cell membrane, where NMDARs can diffuse. Inside the cell volume, all of the interacting molecules are released as per table 1.

# What have other people done?
_Previous multi-state models of CaMKII exist but are different in focus and in scope from the 462 present model. For example, our model is based on an earlier multi-state model by Stefan et al. (2012) 463 [29] implemented in the particle-based stochastic simulator StochSim [70].StochSim does not explicitly account for spatial information. MCell, as a spatial simulator, 466 offers more possibilities to precisely account for spatial effects and to situate models in spatially realistic 467 representations of cellular compartments. In addition, the model by Stefan et al. provides only for 468 interactions between adjacent CaMKII molecules on the same hexamer ring and therefore models 469 CaMKII as a hexamer, not a dodecamer._

rule-based model of the CaMKII holoenzyme by 478 Li and Holmes [26] offers a detailed representation of how CaM binds to Ca2+ and subsequently activates 479 CaMKII subunits, based on earlier results of CaM regulation [75]. Li and Holmes offer valuable and 480 detailed insight into how CaM binding to CaMKII depends on Ca2+ dynamics.

Parris model looks at CaMKII dynamics with CaM particularly, uses mcell - they didnt look at binding with nmdars. This study was done using MCell 3.3 which did not allow for diffusion of multistate molecules. 

Ordyan looks at CaMKII and NMDARs with mcell and bionetgen but does not look at space dynamics - I think? 
Ordyan et al., use rule-based modelling methodology using Monte Carlo methods similar to this work, to investigate how Ca2+ signals influence the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation within the PSD.

_Ordyan et al. (199) developed a multiscale, rule-based model of CaMKII activation that accounted for kinetics of CaMKII modelled as a monomer and a holoenzyme. Their findings suggested that CaMKII functions as a leaky integrator of Ca2+ pulses in the presence of neurogranin (Ng) and PP1, consistent with previous experimental observations in short LTP (46). Their results suggest CaMKII integrates Ca2+ signals in a frequency-dependent manner, which contrasts with the earlier models that propose CaMKII functions as a bistable memory switch (212)._

Likewise, another model supports the idea that CaMKII acts as a leaky integrator of Ca2+ in a PP1-rich environment (243). Rather, CaMKII might exhibit bistability in specific microenvironments, such as the 'core' PSD where it binds to the NMDA receptor (Dosemeci et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2003). Whereas in the spine cytosol, CaMKII has been demonstrated to act not as a bistable switch but as a leaky integrator of calcium activity (Chang et al., 2017).

### How have others modelled calcium binding to cam?
- Pharris et al., 2020: cam is set into the model as either unbound to calcium, or fully saturated, cam bound to 4 calcium (I cannot find how they model this transition).

_CaM and PP are modeled in MCell as conventional cytosolic molecules. CaM is modeled as 132 having one of two states: un-bound apo-CaM and fully-saturated Ca2+/CaM (four Ca2+ bound to CaM). 133 Although we and others have described the importance of sub-saturated Ca2+/CaM states with fewer than 134 4 Ca2+ [12, 24, 31, 44-46], the dynamics of Ca2+-CaM binding and the binding of sub-saturated Ca2+/CaM 135 to CaMKII are beyond the scope of this current work._

- Stefan at al., 2008: ca binds with same affinity regardless of 1, 2 or 4 binding, and affinity is modelled according to dissociation rate:
_The kon for calcium binding was assumed to be the same for all four binding sites and both states, because it can be assumed to be controlled only by calcium and calmodulin diffusion and size (random exploration). Different affinities were represented by different koff values._

### How have others modelled cam binding to camkii?

### How have others modelled camkii P?

### How have others modelled camkii/nmdar interactions, if at all?

## Bartol et al., 2024
Bartol et al. 2024 use particle-based stochastic simulations in MCell4 to model the activation of CaMKII by Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs within a postsynaptic spine. They translate the kinetic properties of CaMKII regulation previously measured _in vitro_ into the context of a computational model of a postsynaptic spine.

Using MCell4 simulations, the paper shows that CaMKII autophosphorylation, influenced by 'Ca2+-calmodulin-trapping' and PP1 dephosphorylation mechanisms, does not behave as a bistable switch, but instead they propose a "kinetic proofreading" mechanism of CaMKII, crucial for synaptic plasticity induction.

They test CaM trapping hypothesis that it leads to an increase in CaMKII autoP during high frequency synaptic stimulation. They _test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of CaM-trapping on the dynamics of activation of CaMKII in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model instantiated in a realistic spine geometry_. _We also investigate how CaM-trapping may regulate dephosphorylation of CaMKII by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), and thus influence the kinetics of autophosphorylation of CaMKII and the response of CaMKII to different stimulation frequencies._
