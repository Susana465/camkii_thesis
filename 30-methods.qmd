# Methods
Abstract

This chapter delves into the methods used to model molecular interactions of interest. Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell and CellBlender, I modeled the interactions of initial molecules released inside the cell, including Ca2+, CaM, CaMKII, PP1, and NMDARs on the cell surface. The binding dynamics of calcium to calmodulin and subsequent interactions with CaMKII ware examined, alongside the states of CaMKII (open/closed, active/inactive) and the phosphorylation processes of CaMKII. 

The results should highlight the importance of CaM binding to CaMKII, and NMDARs, and its regulation through phosphorylation, as well as the role of these interactions in maintaining the phosphorylated state of CaMKII within the postsynaptic density.

## What I want out of this chapter?
Explain CaMKII and NMDARs interactions in detail. Explain how they are structurally interacting, what bonds are binding, and what specific molecules are being attracted or repulsed in each molecule.

DO NOT GET SIDE TRACKED WITH OTHER CHAPTERS. IF IDEAS COME CAN WRITE BUT FOCUS IS ON METHODS (do I want to rewrite this during the writing week? this probably takes quite a big chunk of time, decide on week have this as a maybe), BIOLOGY OF CAMKII AND NMDARS, AND RESULTS. 
I want to specify what happens to CaMKII when its docked, open etc in all the different steps and what this means in terms of conditions of binding etc. What are the assumptions and what are the real conditions for camkii to P or be active, for exmaple?

During the writing retreat, I want to:
- read and specify in writing what happens when camkii docked vs undocked
- tidy up all the info I have already below on CaMKII and NMDARs into a cohesive story
- Tidy up the section where I write what others have done and why mine is different
- Look at the feedback David game a few weeks ago on thesis layout (need to find)
- Add result figures (add at least 4) of molecule reactions

Further objectives I'd like to add here are:
- finish model and see what different conditions I can test, mutants vs wt for example
- look at space dynamics in mcell, need to discuss with supervisors

## Model validation

The processes used in software development can also apply to biological model development. Following @husar2022MCell4, four key points were considered for this project:

1.	Incremental model development: build the model step by step on validated foundations.

2.	Modularity: create self-contained, reusable libraries

3.	Unit testing and validation: ensure parts of the model behave as expected.

4.	Human-readable code: store using version control such as git for easy review by team members. 

What have pharris, ordyan and other people done and how does my model relate and differ.

## Model description

I have constructed the models at different scales to validate CaMKII interactions with other molecules like calmodulin and NMDARs, at increasing levels of complexity. First I re-created a model of CaMKII as a monomer that was previously completed in 2017. The model created uses cBNGL and represents CaMKII as monomers to serve as a proof of concept as well as a starting validation point, as dynamics of this model were previously shown to be within biologically accurate limits. Secondly, I created a model of CaMKII as a hexamer since modelling this molecule as a dodecamer gave rise to a combinatorial explosion due to the high number of possible states and the network of interactions generated. This is currently in the works of being resolved as I run the model using the network-free simulation using MCell. We will then be able to model CaMKII as a dodecamer. Finally, I aim to validate this work against a model from @ordyan2020Interactions, where they successfully modelled CaMKII as a twelve subunit holoenzyme using BioNetGen simulations. 

## Model parameters

## Model creation and visualization in CellBlender

I began the model of CaMKII monomers as described in the 2017 model I created using MCell and CellBlender. At the time, MCell did not allow for molecules be modelled as multi-complexes. Thus, for example, one phosphorylated CaMKII molecule in the model was just a single subunit phosphorylated –not twelve phosphorylated subunits. This model includes Ca2+ binding rates to CaM, CaM binding rates to monomeric CaMKII, and phosphorylation rates of active CaMKII monomers by one another, all depending on how many Ca2+ ions are bound to the CaM molecules involved. CaMKII dephosphorylation by PP1 is modelled, as well as binding interactions of CaMKII with NMDARs. In order to replicate and validate the results obtained from the CaMKII monomer in 2017, I re-wrote all reactions into a cBNGL model using the same parameters used originally. We define a volume previously modelled of 0.5μm3, which is within ranges of spine volume of 0.004 to 0.6 μm3 in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Harris and Stevens, 1989). Using cBNGL, I can specify the above mentioned 3D volume, with a 2D surface compartment acting as the cell membrane, where NMDARs can diffuse. Inside the cell volume, all of the interacting molecules are released as per table 1.


## How are these interactions modelled?
Initial molecules released inside the cell are: Ca2+, CaM, CaMKII and PP1, inside the cytosol, and NMDARs as cell surface molecules. Since four calcium ions are needed to fully saturate CaM (CaM_Ca4) [REFERENCES], five times more calcium than CaM and CaMKII was released to ensure it would not be a limiting factor [TABLE REFERENCE]. 


#### Binding of calcium to calmodulin
CaM can bind one, two, three, and four calcium ions progressively. 
In this model, the C terminal and N terminal binding sites of cam are not specified because we are not focusing on ca binding to cam. 

_Calmodulin comprises a 148aa residue polypeptide with four EF hands divided into C and N lobes capable of binding two calcium ions per lobe [4]._ 

calmodulin lobes have been reported to differ in their kinetics and affinity for Ca2+:
- the N lobe binding faster with lower affinity and 
- the C lobe binding slower with higher affinity._ (Domas paper)*

*Faas et al., 2011: _[...] the N-lobe is the first site of cellular Ca2+ binding. Furthermore, the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding differs between the two lobes and this difference gives rise to distinct properties of each lobe. Our findings show that CaM is efficiently activated upon a rise in cellular Ca2+, which might produce 10–100 times more activated CaM than previously thought._ https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2746 

_An E–F hand consists of an N-terminal helix (the E helix) immediately followed by a centrally located, Ca2coordinating loop and a C-terminal helix (the F helix). The three-dimensional arrangement of these domains is reminiscent of the thumb, index and middle fingers of a hand, hence the name ‘E–F hand’._ [@chin2000Calmodulin]

Sensitivity tests for different parameters of ca binding to cam -> domas' suggestion model.

#### Binding of calmodulin to CaMKII
- Saturated CaM_Ca4 binds to CaMKII ring, T306 needs to be unphosphorylated
-> 5.1 CaMKII + CaM_Ca4 < - > CaMKII_CaM 
_In addition, CaMKII can be made insensitive to Ca2+/CaM by autophosphorylation at T305/T306 located within the Ca2+/CaM binding site [23],[24], a process that is facilitated by interaction with the membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK/CASK) [25],[26]. The balance between the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive and -insensitive CaMKII pool is critical for the regulation of post-synaptic plasticity [27],[28]._

_It has been reported that the binding affinity of CaMKIIα for Ca2+/CaM increases by Thr286 phosphorylation [7]._ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10694-z

_Moreover, Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII with unphosphorylated T306 effectively prevents phosphorylation of this residue [26]. These data are in agreement with our co-crystal structure that showed that both threonine residues (T306/T307) were deeply buried within the Ca2+/CaM complex (Figure 4B)._

_Human CaMKII kinase domains bound Ca2+/CaM with affinities between 1.6 and 3.4×106 Mol−1 (KD: 0.6–0.3 µM)_

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910593/

The microscopic kon for CaM binding to CaMKII has been measured, using a 215 CaMKII peptide and fluorescently labeled DA-CaM, as 1 × 108 M-1s-1 [50].(Pharris et al.,).

CaM only binds at high affinity to CaMKII, skipping binding at "initially bound", closed CaMKII. 
Can CaM bind if CaMKII is closed? - what do studies say. the answer is no. 
CaM can bind to CaMKII even if the former is not fully saturated with calcium, but not in our model. 

 It has previously been suggested that two binding sites for calmodulin exist on CaMKII, with high and low affinities. cam has been suggested to be able to bind to the low affinity site when camkii is in the closed state (stefan et al., 2012). Stefan at al., 2012 propose that trapping of cam requires cam to bind to the low affinity site of camkii when camkii is closed (to keep cam bound to camkii even as it closes?). 

what I am proposing in this work, according to what I have read so far [ORGANISE REFERENCES], is that cam can remain bound and in fact in a "trapped" position even without modelling the low affinity binding. cam can be trapped with camkii as it's binding affinity increases with camkii subunit phosphorylation at t286. 


## CaM-trapping and how we model it

<- _One of the effects of autophosphorylation at Thr286 is to increase the apparent affinity of CaMKII for calmodulin, a phenomenon known as "calmodulin trapping"_ Stefan et al., 2012.

Molecular dynamics simulation showed that while binding of calmodulin to the supposed low-affinity binding site on CaMKII is compatible with closing (and hence, inactivation) of the kinase, and could even favour it, binding to the high-affinity site is not. Stochastic simulations of a biochemical model showed that the existence of two such binding sites, one of them accessible only in the active, open conformation, would be sufficient to explain calmodulin trapping by CaMKII. 

We can explain the effect of CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 on calmodulin trapping: It stabilises the active state and therefore makes the high-affinity binding site accessible. 

Crucially, a model with only one binding site where calmodulin binding and CaMKII inactivation are strictly mutually exclusive cannot reproduce calmodulin trapping.  One of the predictions of our study is that calmodulin binding in itself is not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of calmodulin is.

-> Stefan et al., 2012.

#### States of CaMKII

CaMKII functions are regulated through phosphorylation at multiple sites, and its localization within cells is directed by interactions with specific binding proteins.

CaMKII can exist in different states: open or closed, active or inactive, docked or undocked.

- Active~1 indicates a subunit is undocked and open.
- CaM can only bind if the subunit is active~1.
- Pharris is modeling the undocked, closed state, but I am modeling the direct transition from docked/closed to undocked/open, skipping the intermediate step.

CaMKII flickers between active/open and inactive/closed state. essential biological functions are the same, but perhaps modeled slightly differently for efficiency of running the model.

I am focusing on modeling the high-affinity binding of CaM to CaMKII, because this is shown to be sufficient for CaMKII activation. [Stefan et al., 2012 and what other references?]

Can CaMKII close or become inactive if it is phosphorylated? Yes -> see t305/6 phosphorylation actions below. 

Electron microscopy of rat alpha-CaMKII in Sf9 cells, as per @myers2017CaMKII, suggests that less than 3 percent of subunits adopt a compact conformation (Figure 6).

#### Phosphorylation of CaMKII

Modelling studies (Lisman, 1985; Miller et al., 2005) have suggested that intersubunit autophosphorylation can maintain the phosphorylated state of the kinase once it is located in the PSD; each subunit is catalytic and, if itself phosphorylated at T286, can phosphorylate T286 on a nearby subunit that might become dephosphorylated (this reaction requires that the substrate subunit has calmodulin bound as a result of basal Ca2+ levels (Hanson et al., 1994)). Recent reconstitution experiments directly demonstrate this mechanism (Urakubo et al., 2014).

 CaMKII phosphorylation
# When CaMKII_CaM, neighbouring subunit, if bound to CaM, can P
	CaMKII(l!1,T286~0,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,cam!+) -> CaMKII(l!1,T286~P,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,cam!+) k_pCaM4
# When CaMKII_CaM_P, can phosphorylate neighbouring subunit
  	CaMKII(l!1,T286~0,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,T286~P) -> CaMKII(l!1,T286~P,cam!2).CaM(ca~4,camkii!2).CaMKII(r!1,T286~P) k_pCaM4_P	

(Rostas and Skelding, 2023)_Initial enzyme activity of purified CaMKII requires the binding of both calcium and calmodulin. Following this, autophosphorylation of Thr286 in CaMKIIα occurs quickly and produces the following outcomes:_

- A 1000-fold increase in the affinity for CaM_Ca4
So when CaMKII_P binding of CaM_Ca4 is 1000 times more likely to bind (and stay bound) to CaMKII_P. 

This should mean that CaM_Ca4 dissociation rate from CaMKII_P should be quite slow.

-> how do I model this?/is it already modelled in the reactions I have?
Right now:
CaM(ca~4,camkii) + CaMKII(cam,T306~0,active~1) <-> CaM(ca~4,camkii!1).CaMKII(cam!1,T306~0,active~1) kon_cam_ca4_camkii, koff_cam_ca4_camkii

Which means that CaM can bind to CaMKII regardless of whether T286 is phosphorylated or not. 

* camkii_p at t286 + cam -> will have a higher binding rate than when not p at t286.

the active cam bound kinetics of camkii will be different to the active cam unbound kinetics. so i think this should be specified in the model. 

right now after conversations with melanie we decided to just add active~1 no matter whether its bound to cam nmdar or just open, but the reactions kinetics will vary depending on whether camkii is active~1 because of flickering, cam bound or nmdar bound. I think? need to look into literature and maybe this can be a hypothesis to test. 

would camkii activity make a difference if camkii active~1 varies due o being bound to nmdars or cam?

but how do i make it into a hypothesis without biting my own tail? as in, i add x or y kinetics, of course its gonna give x or y results respectively. there are also emergent properties. 

Pharris et al., do a detransition of different steps for dephosphorylation. In this model we have the requirement that cam be not bound to a camkii subunit but otherwise PP1 can act and dephosorylate directly (we don't have a step for binding of pp1, then dephosphorylation
)

_Autophosphorylation unmasks a phenylalanine (F) and a glutamine (N) in the CaM-binding domain (shown in red), enabling a large increase in the affinity of Ca2+/CaM, known as CaM-trapping._

It is well established that each subunit within the 12meric CaMKII holoenzyme is activated separately by direct binding of Ca2+/CaM [for review, see (16)]. However, when Ca2+/CaM binds to two neighboring subunits, it additionally induces a fast trans-subunit autophosphorylation at T286 (46, 47), which generates autonomous kinase activity that outlasts the initial Ca2+ stimulus. Then, dissociation of Ca2+/CaM exposes T305/306 for phosphorylation by the autonomous CaMKII. 

 from paper-> our results indicate that pT286 and Ca2+/CaM may not substantially differ in the degree of opening the inhibitory gate that is provided by the regulatory domain. Instead, pT305/306 actively contributes to some level of direct inhibition, independently from preventing Ca2+/CaM binding. 
 The trans-pT305/306 reaction requires previous pT286 on the neighboring subunit that acts as the kinase but then leads also to a feed-forward inhibition of subsequent pT286 on these pT305/306-only subunits. 

 The trans-pT305/306 reaction requires previous pT286 on the neighboring subunit that acts as the kinase but then leads also to a feed-forward inhibition of subsequent pT286 on these pT305/306-only subunits. Together, these mechanisms enable a wide array of finely tuned possible states for each CaMKII holoenzyme, with each state tightly linked to the inducing Ca2+ stimulus. 

 For instance, for a trans-pT305/306 to completely shut down a kinase subunit, the Ca2+ stimulus must be sufficiently high to induce some pT286 within the holoenzyme (which requires Ca2+/CaM binding to two neighboring subunits) but sufficiently low to not induce pT286 on all of the neighboring subunits.

T305/306 phosphorylation
this phosphorylation is associated with autoinhibition of CaMKII. This phosphorylation stabilizes the interaction between the regulatory domain and the catalytic domain, locking CaMKII in an inactive state, preventing calmodulin binding. 

Lucic et al., 2008 -> Detailed state model of CaMKII activation and autophosphorylation

We cannot exclude the
possibility that the exact amount of T305 phosphorylated
CaMKII was determined inaccurately because the
Eur Biophys J (2008) 38:83–98 87
123
anti-phospho T286 CaMKII antibody has different affinity
for T305 phosphorylated aCaMKII. However, this would
not change the outcome of our simulations because, as we
show below, that autophosphorylation at T305 does not
significantly affect the autophosphorylation at T286 under
our experimental conditions.

This is an intra-subunit phosphorylation that reduces the catalytic activity of CaMKII-> (Hashimoto et al. 1987; Lou and Schulman 1989). It can occur after CaM dissociates from a T286 autophosphorylated subunit, and it prevents the rebinding of CaM
(Hashimoto et al. 1987; Patton et al. 1990).

slower CaMKII autophosphorylation at T305/306 inhibits stimulation by Ca2+/CaM, but occurs only minimally for CaMKII wild type during CaM-stimulated activity assays. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037176 
-> _Previous studies that used the effect on stimulated CaMKII activity as a readout indicated similar rates for the T305/T306 burst phosphorylation (∼0.01–0.05 sec−1, based on the time observed for half-maximal kinase inhibition) [37], [39], [40],_

Another physiologically relevant phosphorylation site is
T305/306 at aCaMKII (T306/307 at bCaMKII, both
denoted as T305 phosphorylation) (Hashimoto et al. 1987;
Lou and Schulman 1989). This is an intra-subunit phosphorylation that reduces the catalytic activity of CaMKII
(Hashimoto et al. 1987; Lou and Schulman 1989). It can
occur after CaM dissociates from a T286 autophosphorylated subunit, and it prevents the rebinding of CaM
(Hashimoto et al. 1987; Patton et al. 1990) @lucic2008Detailed

biological importance proposal:
(My own thoughts) This stabilization mechanism may act as a form of kinetic proofreading by ensuring that CaMKII remains inactive or less active unless sustained or repetitive calcium signals are present. It prevents premature or excessive kinase activity, thereby enhancing the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling in response to synaptic activity.

Finding about t305/306 phosphorylation _in vitro_ transgenic mice @pi2010Autonomous (in presence of cam)
- T286D mutant: autonomous CaMKII that are constitutively active and do not require calcium/calmodulin binding for activation.

Contrary to initial expectations where T286D CaMKII was thought to only potentiate synaptic strength (mimicking LTP), the researchers found that depending on the phosphorylation status at Thr305/306, T286D CaMKII could also induce synaptic depression (mimicking LTD).

T286D/T305D/T306D (pseudophosphorylated form): Led to synaptic depression (LTD-like process).
T286D/T305A/T306A (form where T305/T306 cannot be phosphorylated - this would mean camkii is not regulated back into autoinhibited state through T305 phosphorylation): Prevented LTD and instead promotes potentiation (LTP-like effect).

t305/306 phosphorylation as also been shown to prevent camkii's activity-dependent translocation to the postsynaptic density. so if camkii is not phosphorylated at t305/306, it may translocate to PSD, but if this site is phosphorylated, translocation will be reduced - which fits in with the idea that t305/306 once again is like a "dimmer switch"

Two main notes from Susana
- Okay so we know that t305 phosphorylation structutrally impedes/reduces affinity of cam binding (which are not the same thing but have relatively similar outcomes of cam binding less to camkii)

- but also, phosphorylation at the t305 site - does it render camkii in an inactive, autonibited state, or can camkii that is p at t305 remain active? need to find this in lterature. yes, it is likely it reduces camkii activity as it renders each subunit into the closed, inactive, autoinhibited state. 



#### Binding of CaMKII to NMDARs
Which part of CaMKII binds to NMDAR? Is there overlap of cam binding to camkii vs nmdar/camkii binding? There is no overlap, cam can bind to camkii even if this is bound to nmdars. 

CaMKII kinase domain binds to NMDARs. The kinase domain in CaMKII is responsible for the enzyme's kinase activity, which includes binding ATP and transferring a phosphate group to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, such as S1303 on the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. 

Activation of the kinase domain typically involves relief of autoinhibition, often through binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM).

CaMKII directly interacts with GluN2B which anchors CaMKII at the synapse in an
active conformation (Bayer et al., 2001). Targeting CaMKII to the PSD via its interaction
with GluN2B is critical for the phosphorylation of GluA1 subunits of the AMPA receptor
among many other PSD proteins (Lisman et al., 2002; Barria and Malinow, 2005; Zhou et al.,
2007). 

CaMKII directly binds both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits via binding sites located in
the CTDs of the receptor subunits (Bayer et al., 2001, 2006; Gardoni et al., 1999; Leonard et al., 1999;
Strack et al., 2000); however, it has a greater affinity for GluN2B (Strack and Colbran, 1998). 

Two CaMKII-binding sites have been identified in the GluN2B subunit at residues 839–1120 and 1290–1310 (Strack and
Colbran, 1998; Leonard et al., 1999; Strack et al., 2000; Bayer et al., 2001) @kellermayer2018Superresolution

Transient CaMKII activity evokes an initial reversible, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent binding of GluN2B
to the substrate-binding site within the catalytic domain of CaMKII, whereas prolonged
enzymatic activity leads to a persistent interaction between GluN2B and the Thr286-binding
site of CaMKII, locking CaMKII in an active conformation, as mentioned above

Autophosphorylation of Thr286 allows CaMKII to bind to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor [85,94]. 

CaMKII bound to GluN2B induces a conformational change in CaMKII, which allows CaMKII to maintain its autonomous activity even if CaMKII is dephosphorylated at Thr286. Even if calmodulin dissociates following a drop in intracellular calcium levels, CaMKII can remain active (have autonomous activity without calcium/cam).

Phosphorylation of Thr305/306 that would occur in autonomously active CaMKII is inhibited when CaMKII is bound to GluN2B -> need to find reference as to how this happens. probably because the binding keeps the kinase domain from closing into the autoinhibitory domain. 

This allows CaMKII bound to GluN2B to bind cam_ca4 again following a subsequent increase in intracellular calcium concentrations.

CaMKII bound to GluN2B Subunit Exhibits Increased ATP Affinity and Attenuated Dephosphorylation @cheriyan2011Calcium

Competitive actions of DAPK1 in LTD - for future work? or can I add to model?

T305/306 phosphorylation directly reduces binding to GluN2B
CaMKII binding to GluN2B participates in enhancing synaptic strength (26, 27), consistent with our findings with the CaMKII I205K mutant (Fig. 2A). Thus, we decided to test the effects of T305/306 phosphorylation on CaMKII/GluN2B interaction. T305/306 phosphorylation had been suggested to reduce CaMKII binding to GluN2B (29); however, these experiments did not differentiate between a direct effect of the phosphorylation and an indirect effect via reduced Ca2+/CaM binding. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101658/

# What have other people done?
_Previous multi-state models of CaMKII exist but are different in focus and in scope from the 462 present model. For example, our model is based on an earlier multi-state model by Stefan et al. (2012) 463 [29] implemented in the particle-based stochastic simulator StochSim [70].StochSim does not explicitly account for spatial information. MCell, as a spatial simulator, 466 offers more possibilities to precisely account for spatial effects and to situate models in spatially realistic 467 representations of cellular compartments. In addition, the model by Stefan et al. provides only for 468 interactions between adjacent CaMKII molecules on the same hexamer ring and therefore models 469 CaMKII as a hexamer, not a dodecamer._

Michalski and 470 Loew (2012) bionetgen and vcell.

rule-based model of the CaMKII holoenzyme by 478 Li and Holmes [26] offers a detailed representation of how CaM binds to Ca2+ and subsequently activates 479 CaMKII subunits, based on earlier results of CaM regulation [75]. Li and Holmes offer valuable and 480 detailed insight into how CaM binding to CaMKII depends on Ca2+ dynamics.

Parris model looks at CaMKII dynamics with CaM particularly, uses mcell - they didnt look at binding with nmdars. This study was done using MCell 3.3 which did not allow for diffusion of multistate molecules. 

Ordyan looks at CaMKII and NMDARs with mcell and bionetgen but does not look at space dynamics - I think? 
Ordyan et al., use rule-based modelling methodology using Monte Carlo methods similar to this work, to investigate how Ca2+ signals influence the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation within the PSD.

_Ordyan et al. (199) developed a multiscale, rule-based model of CaMKII activation that accounted for kinetics of CaMKII modelled as a monomer and a holoenzyme. Their findings suggested that CaMKII functions as a leaky integrator of Ca2+ pulses in the presence of neurogranin (Ng) and PP1, consistent with previous experimental observations in short LTP (46). Their results suggest CaMKII integrates Ca2+ signals in a frequency-dependent manner, which contrasts with the earlier models that propose CaMKII functions as a bistable memory switch (212)._

Likewise, another model supports the idea that CaMKII acts as a leaky integrator of Ca2+ in a PP1-rich environment (243). Rather, CaMKII might exhibit bistability in specific microenvironments, such as the 'core' PSD where it binds to the NMDA receptor (Dosemeci et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2003). Whereas in the spine cytosol, CaMKII has been demonstrated to act not as a bistable switch but as a leaky integrator of calcium activity (Chang et al., 2017).

### How have others modelled calcium binding to cam?
- Pharris et al., 2020: cam is set into the model as either unbound to calcium, or fully saturated, cam bound to 4 calcium (I cannot find how they model this transition).

_CaM and PP are modeled in MCell as conventional cytosolic molecules. CaM is modeled as 132 having one of two states: un-bound apo-CaM and fully-saturated Ca2+/CaM (four Ca2+ bound to CaM). 133 Although we and others have described the importance of sub-saturated Ca2+/CaM states with fewer than 134 4 Ca2+ [12, 24, 31, 44-46], the dynamics of Ca2+-CaM binding and the binding of sub-saturated Ca2+/CaM 135 to CaMKII are beyond the scope of this current work._

- Stefan at al., 2008: ca binds with same affinity regardless of 1, 2 or 4 binding, and affinity is modelled according to dissociation rate:
_The kon for calcium binding was assumed to be the same for all four binding sites and both states, because it can be assumed to be controlled only by calcium and calmodulin diffusion and size (random exploration). Different affinities were represented by different koff values._

### How have others modelled cam binding to camkii?

### How have others modelled camkii P?

### How have others modelled camkii/nmdar interactions, if at all?

## Bartol et al., 2024
Bartol et al. 2024 use particle-based stochastic simulations in MCell4 to model the activation of CaMKII by Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs within a postsynaptic spine. They translate the kinetic properties of CaMKII regulation previously measured _in vitro_ into the context of a computational model of a postsynaptic spine.

Using MCell4 simulations, the paper shows that CaMKII autophosphorylation, influenced by 'Ca2+-calmodulin-trapping' and PP1 dephosphorylation mechanisms, does not behave as a bistable switch, but instead they propose a "kinetic proofreading" mechanism of CaMKII, crucial for synaptic plasticity induction.

They test CaM trapping hypothesis that it leads to an increase in CaMKII autoP during high frequency synaptic stimulation. They _test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of CaM-trapping on the dynamics of activation of CaMKII in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model instantiated in a realistic spine geometry_. _We also investigate how CaM-trapping may regulate dephosphorylation of CaMKII by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), and thus influence the kinetics of autophosphorylation of CaMKII and the response of CaMKII to different stimulation frequencies._
