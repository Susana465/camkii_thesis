# Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank myself for persevering throughout this PhD, for going to therapy all throughout it, and for being patient with myself and this PhD. It feels a bit unusual to both thank myself and mention therapy in the acknowledgment section, but the personal growth I’ve experienced feels significant enough to be recognized —for both myself and the future. I am proud of myself. I can see the differences in my confidence when it comes to coding and my knowledge of what and how I want things done. This journey has been one of love, patience, and consistent effort.

I'd like to thank my friend Ceilidh, who has been a refreshing, loving, and solid friendship that I did not expect would happen midway through my PhD. You have been a major propulsor and inspiration to get through this PhD.  

I am very grateful for the opportunity to have been an enrichment student at The Alan Turing Institute during the 2022–2023 cohort. It was a catalytic moment for me and really propelled my PhD into what I wanted it to be. The people I met during this time have made a huge impact on my academic and personal life, and I am forever grateful. This experience was also an opening door to the Turing Way Community, whom I would also like to thank as a whole, but particularly some of the people with whom I have had extremely meaningful conversations that have steered the direction of my PhD: Anne Le Steele, Claudia Fischer, Malvika Sharan, and Kirstie Whittaker.

Honestly, I'd like to thank my family and particularly my siblings, Felipe y Clara, who remind me constantly to care for myself first, fill up my cup, and, in doing so, show up to anything else with revitalized energy, including this PhD.

Thank you.
