# Learning and Memory

Abstract:

This PhD project investigates the temporal and spatial dynamics of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) interactions within dendritic postsynaptic density. Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell and CellBlender, I model their interactions. Throughout this project, I identify key factors influencing the efficacy and dynamics of these interactions. These findings contribute to understanding synaptic plasticity mechanisms crucial for memory formation. This chapter lays out the biological background of what we already know about how CaMKII and NMDARs are interacting to be key molecules underlying LTP and consequently learning and memory.

_Am I able to reproduce results from previous undergrad thesis? or reproduce what ordyan concluded? what literature is out there already?_

## A brief history background on learning and memory research:

Memory can be broadly divided into declarative and non-declarative memory [@milner1998CognitiveNeuroscienceStudy]. Declarative memory is what we usually mean by the term "memory" and involves the conscious recollection of facts and events. Non-declarative memory underlies the changes in skilled behaviour and its improvement with practice. The cellular changes that underline these two forms of memory differ, but both are thought to involve changes in the strength of neuronal connections as proposed by @ramonycajal1909HistologieSystemeNerveux more than a century ago. The notion that synaptic strength changes during learning and memory was refined into a concrete model by @hebb1949OrganizationBehaviorNeuropsychological. Hebb proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time, the synapses between them are strengthened. He hypothesized that the neurons involved in establishing a network must already be connected by synapses in order for these synapses to be strengthened or weakened. Networks are thus created from pre-existing “wiring” (Figures 2 and 3). Some of these pre-wired networks, such as those in the hippocampus, then play a key role in the formation of memories. This hypothesis inspired many researchers, and the first mechanism supporting it, long-term potentiation, was discovered in the early 1970s. 

## Long Term Potentiation 

The discovery of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) showed that short, high frequency stimulation (tetanus) of hippocampal excitatory synapses produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the strength of these synapses that could persist for many days. To this day, LTP has been described at synapses throughout the brain and remains one of the most attractive cellular models for learning and memory. There are multiple forms of LTP. The variables include the type of synapse, the stimulation parameters, the time analysed after LTP induction, and the developmental age. A good example of different forms of LTP can be seen if we compare LTP at CA1 hippocampal synapses versus mossy fibre synapses at CA3 pyramidal cells. LTP at CA1 synapses, which can be representative of LTP at excitatory synapses, is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and primarily involves a modification of the postsynaptic neuron. Mossy fibre LTP, on the other hand, is independent of NMDA receptors and has been shown to be entirely expressed presynaptically [@nicoll2005SynapticPlasticityHippocampal]. There are also reports using rats that show a mechanistic difference between neonatal rat babies (10 days old) and more mature rats [@bolshakov1995RegulationHippocampalTransmitter; @palmer2004MultipleDevelopmentallyRegulated; @yasuda2003DevelopmentalSwitchSignaling]. 

An important note on scientific bias here is necessary: @bolshakov1995RegulationHippocampalTransmitter, for example, don't mention how the rats were killed, they mention how they obtained and prepared the brain slices, as their study focuses on _in-vitro_, not _in-vivo_ research. These slices came from Sprague-Dawley rats;  raised and killed as babies, most likely through CO2 asphyxiation, which has been shown to cause suffering [@wong2013RatAversionIsoflurane]. The most common way of killing rodents in science is either through carbon dioxide or decapitation, as reported by a review in 2013 in nature, and still are regularly used [@cressey2013BestWayKill; @dalnegroPracticalHandbook3Rs].  These topics are usually labelled in conversation as “difficult to discuss” because bringing an awareness about the suffering we cause to sentient beings hurts. There is a heavy dissonance when researchers are presented with animal research suffering and killing.

Bringing awareness about how we write and speak about animal research is something that will ripple through this research, as I am (painfully) aware that a lot of the research knowledge that I mention is known due to non-human animal experimentation. In fact, LTP was first discovered by using rabbit’s hippocampus [@lomo1971PatternsActivationMonosynaptic]. 

It is LTP that depends on NMDAR activation where much research has been done [@malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @nicoll2017BriefHistoryLongTerm]. Likewise, in this project we mainly focus on this type of LTP. In order to fully grasp how NMDAR-dependent LTP works, and how this process includes an early phase (a component of LTP lasting 60 minutes or so), and a late phase, (a protein synthesis-dependent component of LTP), we will first have a look at two of the star proteins in this project: NMDARs and CaMKII.
