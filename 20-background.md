# Background

The background chapter will touch on some key concepts that are key to understanding where this project stands. First we explore how this PhD sits within systems biology. Systems biology involves the development and application of systems theory concepts to study complex biological systems through an iterative process of mathematical modeling, computational simulation, and biological experimental data. Allowing for a comprehensive understanding of biological phenomena by integrating data across various scales and modalities. 

Next, the principles of open science and reproducibility are discussed. These principles are particularly relevant for this project as they underpin the methodological rigor and ethical standards adhered to throughout the research process. Finally, I discuss what types of computer modeling are used for this PhD project to address its biological questions. These models range from deterministic approaches, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to stochastic methods and rule-based modeling. The following sections will delve into these themes in greater detail, outlining their importance and application in the context of this research.
