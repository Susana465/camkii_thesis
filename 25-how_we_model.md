# How do we model biochemical systems networks?
As we saw in the background section, key processes in biological and chemical systems are described by networks of chemical reactions; i.e., all the cascades of interactions between CaMKII with other molecules can be understood as a network of chemical reactions. And, as mentioned above, computational models of these reaction networks can be used to elucidate their dynamics. 

Reaction-based models are formalized as sets of reactions that describe the given system in terms of mechanistic interactions between the species of interest. This is, biochemical networks are a set of chemical species that can be converted into each other through chemical reactions. The focus of biochemical network models is usually on the levels of the chemical species and this usually requires explicit mathematical expressions for the velocity at which the reactions proceed. Biological systems can be simulated in different ways using different algorithms depending on the assumptions made about the underlying kinetics. Once the kinetics have been specified, these systems can be used directly to construct full dynamic simulations of the system behaviour on a computer.

##  What are deterministic modelling and stochastic modelling?

### **Deterministic modelling:**
Deterministic approaches to chemical kinetics are often used to characterize time evolutions of chemical reactions in large systems. A popular representation for these models is to use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the change in the concentrations of chemical species. Such descriptions are appropriate when the number of particles involved in the biochemical network is large enough to be able to consider continuous concentrations and when spatial effects are negligible, i.e. well-mixed environment is assumed and space has no effect on reactions. In ODE-based models, each chemical species in the network is represented by an ODE that describes the rate of change of that species along time. Therefore, ODE models of biochemical processes are useful and accurate in the high-concentration limit, but often fail to capture stochastic cellular dynamics accurately because the deterministic continuous formulation assumes spatial homogeneity and continuous biomolecule concentrations.

These ODE models can be used to simulate the dynamics of the concentrations of the chemical species along time given their initial values. This is achieved by numerical integration of the system of ODE which can be carried out with well-established algorithms (e.g. simple forward Euler method). They are also useful to find, for example, steady states of the system, which are conditions when the concentrations of the chemical species do not change @maly2009Introduction.

### **Stochastic modelling:**
Another representation that is useful in systems biology is stochastic simulations, which use probability distribution functions to estimate when single reaction events happen and therefore track the number of particles of the chemical species. As a general rule, stochastic simulations are preferred where the numbers of particles of a chemical species is small; the ODE approach is required when the number of particles is large because the stochastic approach might be computationally intractable. When the assumption of continuous concentration fails due to small-scale cellular environment with limited reactant populations, ODE representation also fails. It is here when stochastic simulations are useful.

Chemical stochastic systems are usually represented by a chemical master equation (CME) that describes the time evolution of the probability distribution of discrete molecule quantities, i.e. the CME describes temporal evolution of the probability density function (PDF) for states of a chemical system. PDFs are used to describe the timing of reaction events. This evolution of probability is a continuous time Markov chain, of which any possible realizations can be generated through the Monte Carlo sampling methods. The most famous of these methods for coupled chemical reactions is the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) of Gillespie. The theoretical derivation of this method can be found in (Gillespie, 1976)(Gillespie, 1977) as well as a more recent review (Gillespie, 2007).

It is important to stress that one simulation run according to stochastic approaches is only one realization of a probabilistic representation, and thus provides limited amount of information on its own. When running stochastic simulations, it is very important that they are repeated for a sufficient number of times in order to reveal the entire range of behaviour presented by such a system (i.e., to estimate a distribution for each chemical species and its dynamic evolution). An example of what these model runs can look like are shown in Figure 8.

## What is rule-based modelling?

An intricate network of protein–protein interactions is a prominent feature of any signal-transduction system @gomperts2009Signal, @hunter2000Signaling. Yet despite the high relevance of modelling site-specific details on protein-protein interactions of signalling systems, there has been a lack of standards for explicitly representing the composition and connectivity of molecular complexes @ezkurdia2009Progress. Models that incorporate complex protein-protein interaction details are generally difficult or impossible to specify and analyse, largely because of the combinatorial number of protein modifications and protein complexes that can be generated through protein–protein interactions. As explained in the Complexity Systems section of this report, this is known as combinatorial complexity which is a common challenge to our understanding of cellular regulation. We will see below how this can be resolved with rule based modelling, and more specifically with BioNetGen tools.

### BioNetGen 

BioNetGen is a set of software tools which facilitate a rule-based approach to modelling biochemical reaction kinetics, where we can largely overcome the problem of combinatorial complexity. BioNetGen language (BNGL) is a formal language which uses the BioNetGen software @faeder2009Rulebased. It allows for site-specific details of protein-protein interactions to be captured in models for the dynamics of these interactions in a systematic fashion, which also alleviates nomenclature and reusability issues. Hence, using this RBM approach is notable as it facilitates writing of multi-state modelling and can significantly, reduce the number of reactions that need to be written due to its “don’t write, don’t care” characteristic. Thereby dramatically improving the ability to model CaMKII as a dodecamer; I can make a model with multistate molecules, and specify the states of the reactants that are relevant for a particular reaction, and leave the rest unspecified. 

### Simple example of RBM using BioNetGen

An example of how RBM and it’s don’t care, don’t write capacity works can be found here, where the reader can access instructions on how to run a rule-based model written in BioNetGen. Additionally, some snippets of how this works in the code can be found below on Figure 9. Likewise, another example is given in Figure 10 which has a similar model with diagrams to explain how BNGL specific binding sites modelling functions. The name “BioNetGen” is a mnemonic for “Biological Network Generator”, but the name does not encompass all the software’s capabilities. The software not only generates reaction networks from rules, but also simulates such networks using different methods. It uses iterative application of rules to a set of seed species, which may be used to generate a network in advance of a simulation; the simulation may subsequently be carried out either by numerically solving ODEs or by implementing SSA approaches (Figure 13). So, for example, using the same model as described in Figure 2, the same model can be simulated using either the SSA or ODE method; these models are available to run online using a jupyter notebook here too. A screenshot for each simulation type can be found below in Figure 11.

### Compartmental BionetGen

Compartmental BionNetGen is an extension of BNGL to enable explicit modelling of the compartmental organization of the cell and it’s effects on system dynamics (Figure 12). It introduces localization attributes for molecular species, as well as appropriate volumetric scaling of reaction rates. When modelling with BNG, a well-mixed environment is assumed and space has no effect on reactions. Importantly, cBNGL considers the division of the system into well mixed sub-volumes. Counterintuitively, a volume can be specified, which allows for further calculations of molecule concentrations, but it has no real effect on space since BNGL assumes the environment to be well-mixed @harris2009Compartmental. We use cBNGL for describing our multimeric models of CaMKII, so that we can model certain molecules interacting inside a cytoplasm and receptors to be modelled in a plasma membrane. 

### Network generation in BioNetGen
Every time a BNG model runs, a network of reactions can be created. This can be modified through the command “overwrite>1/0” (detailed specification can be found here (Faeder et al., 2009)) , which allows you to choose whether you want to overwrite and create or not a new network each time you run the model. In network-based simulations, the full reaction network is enumerated. This is okay for smaller systems without a big number of reactions, but can become a liability when huge networks need to be computed every time the simulation is run, running into the combinatorial explosion problem. On the other hand, network-free simulations, such as the Network-Free Stochastic Simulator (NFsim) that BNG can use (Figure 13), only keeps track of the state of the system that actually exists, not every possible set of reactions (the reaction network). This makes simulating systems with a large reaction network and a high degree of combinatorial complexity not only possible, but also fast. Additionally,  BNG has  an  ”on-the-fly”  capability available for stochastic simulations,  which does not re-quire a pre-existing network and instead generates the full  network  using  the  model  rules  as  the  simulation takes place @faeder2009Rulebased.
