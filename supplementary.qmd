## PhD Project Scope
Changes in synaptic strength, like Long-Term Depression (LTD) and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), involve diverse chemical pathways that have been used to explore the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008Dissecting]. In particular, studying learning and memory at the molecular level reveals that NMDAR and CaMKII, interacting with other proteins within dendritic spines, play a role in influencing dendritic spines' shape and function [@fink2002Moleculara]. Studies using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment [@moyano2004NMDA;@zhou2007Interactionsa;@halt2012CaMKII].

## Software specifications
**MCell4** is a biochemistry simulation tool that uses stochastic Monte Carlo algorithms to simulate movements and interactions of discrete molecules within and between cells, and Brownian motion to model molecule diffusion. This means that 3D spatially realistic models can be created, where volume molecules diffuse, and all molecules within a given radius along its trajectory, or at the point of collision on a surface, are considered for a reaction. A detailed description of mathematical foundations of MCellâ€™s algorithms can be found here: [@bartol2000Monte;@kerr2008Fast;@bartol2015Computational]. Additionally, CellBlender release 4.0 is used as a plug-in for the 3D modelling software Blender 2.93 [@flavell2011Beginning], which provides a graphical user interface for working with and visualizing MCell4 models [@gupta2018Spatiala]. 

**BioNetGen (release 2.8.5)** is a set of software tools that enable a rule-based approach to modelling biochemical reaction kinetics, and can work in combination with MCell modelling. Rule-based modelling represents molecules as structured objects, and then rules are used to define the interactions of these molecules, i.e. molecular interactions are modelled as rules for transforming the attributes of these objects. This use of rules helps to deal with the complexity that can arise from the vast number of protein modifications and complexes generated through protein-protein interactions. BioNetGen Language also allows for site-specific details of protein-protein interactions to be captured in models, which facilitates modelling of holoenzyme structures such as that of CaMKII [@harris2016BioNetGen]. Together, MCell and BioNetGen make it possible to model CaMKII as a dodecamer that interacts with NMDARs and other molecules in a 3D simulation of a dendritic spine.

**BioDynaMo (release 1.04)** is an agent-based modelling tool which can model 3D biophysical molecular interactions [@breitwieser2022BioDynaMo]. In this project, BioDynaMo provides the capability to simulate neuronal growth through formation of an actin cytoskeleton inside dendritic spines, a process with which CaMKII has been shown to be involved with [@okamoto2007Rolea;@zalcman2018CaMKII;@khan2019Architectural]. The model works with actin filaments represented as molecular agents. These can then be modelled to support tree-like structures that can branch out, sever, polymerize and depolymerize in similar manners to the biological equivalent [@trajlinek2022How]. BioDynaMo uses a combination of environment search algorithms [@breitwieser2022BioDynaMo] and data analysis framework such as ROOT [@brun1997ROOT] which allow for simulation of different types of agent diffusion and performing of statistical analysis from simulation data.
