  abstract = {Memory is fundamentally important to everyday life, and memory loss has devastating consequences to individuals and society. Understanding the neurophysiological and cellular basis of memory paves the way for gaining insights into the molecular steps involved in memory formation, thereby revealing potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. For three decades, long-term potentiation (LTP) has been the gold standard synaptic model for mammalian memory mechanisms, in large part because of its long-lasting nature. Here, the authors summarize the characteristics of LTP persistence in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, comparing this with other hippocampal subregions and neocortex. They consider how long LTP can last and how its persistence is affected by subsequent behavioral experiences. Next, they review the molecular mechanisms known to contribute to LTP induction and persistence, in particular the role of new gene expression and protein synthesis and how they may be associated with potential structural reorganization of the synapse. A temporal schema for the processes important for consolidating LTP into a persistent form is presented. The parallels between the molecular aspects of LTP and memory strongly support the continuation with LTP as a model system for studying the mechanisms underlying long-term memory consolidation and retention.},

  abstract = {It has been 70 years since Donald Hebb published his formalized theory of synaptic adaptation during learning. Hebb’s seminal work foreshadowed some of the great neuroscientific discoveries of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term potentiation and other lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, and more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community’s best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates. In this review, we address the key findings from the synaptic plasticity literature that make these phenomena such attractive memory mechanisms. We then turn our attention to evidence that questions the reliance of memory exclusively on changes at the synapse and attempt to integrate these opposing views.},

  abstract = {Publication bias is a substantial problem for the credibility of research in general and of meta-analyses in particular, as it yields overestimated effects and may suggest the existence of non-existing effects. Although there is consensus that publication bias exists, how strongly it affects different scientific literatures is currently less well-known. We examined evidence of publication bias in a large-scale data set of primary studies that were included in 83 meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin (representing meta-analyses from psychology) and 499 systematic reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR; representing meta-analyses from medicine). Publication bias was assessed on all homogeneous subsets (3.8\% of all subsets of meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin) of primary studies included in meta-analyses, because publication bias methods do not have good statistical properties if the true effect size is heterogeneous. Publication bias tests did not reveal evidence for bias in the homogeneous subsets. Overestimation was minimal but statistically significant, providing evidence of publication bias that appeared to be similar in both fields. However, a Monte-Carlo simulation study revealed that the creation of homogeneous subsets resulted in challenging conditions for publication bias methods since the number of effect sizes in a subset was rather small (median number of effect sizes equaled 6). Our findings are in line with, in its most extreme case, publication bias ranging from no bias until only 5\% statistically nonsignificant effect sizes being published. These and other findings, in combination with the small percentages of statistically significant primary effect sizes (28.9\% and 18.9\% for subsets published in Psychological Bulletin and CDSR), led to the conclusion that evidence for publication bias in the studied homogeneous subsets is weak, but suggestive of mild publication bias in both psychology and medicine.},

  abstract = {Publication bias refers to a systematic deviation from the truth in the results of a meta-analysis due to the higher likelihood for published studies to be included in meta-analyses than unpublished studies. Publication bias can lead to misleading recommendations for decision and policy making. In this education review, we introduce, explain, and provide solutions to the pervasive misuses and misinterpretations of publication bias that afflict evidence syntheses in sport and exercise medicine, with a focus on the commonly used funnel-plot based methods. Publication bias is more routinely assessed by visually inspecting funnel plot asymmetry, although it has been consistently deemed unreliable, leading to the development of statistical tests to assess publication bias. However, most statistical tests of publication bias (i) cannot rule out alternative explanations for funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., between-study heterogeneity, choice of metric, chance) and (ii) are grossly underpowered, even when using an arbitrary minimum threshold of ten or more studies. We performed a cross-sectional meta-research investigation of how publication bias was assessed in systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in the top two sport and exercise medicine journals throughout 2021. This analysis highlights that publication bias is frequently misused and misinterpreted, even in top tier journals. Because of conceptual and methodological problems when assessing and interpreting publication bias, preventive strategies (e.g., pre-registration, registered reports, disclosing protocol deviations, and reporting all study findings regardless of direction or magnitude) offer the best and most efficient solution to mitigate the misuse and misinterpretation of publication bias. Because true publication bias is very difficult to determine, we recommend that future publications use the term “risk of publication bias”.},

  abstract = {We examined the timing and mechanisms of CaMKIIα recruitment to nascent synapses of developing rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons in slice culture. Time-lapse confocal imaging shows that GFP-CaMKIIα in transfected neurons accumulates in spines as they are forming, and loss of CaMKIIα coincides with spine destabilization. Immunolabeling shows that endogenous CaMKIIα is concentrated at postsynaptic sites in spines under ambient slice culture conditions, and this is not disrupted by short-term (3 h) synaptic activity blockade or Latrunculin-induced F-actin depolymerization. However, the combination of activity blockade and F-actin depolymerization significantly reduces synaptic CaMKIIα. Conversely, postsynaptic activation induces synaptic recruitment of CaMKIIα even in the presence of F-actin depolymerizing drugs. Thus, synaptic-activity-dependent mechanisms and (synaptic activity-independent) F-actin-based mechanisms are individually sufficient and act in parallel to localize CaMKIIα to the dendritic spine compartment. Moreover, the timing of CaMKIIα recruitment to developing spines suggests a role for CaMKIIα in spine assembly and maintenance.},

  abstract = {GluN2B (GluRε2/NR2B) subunit is involved in synapse development, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. However, its roles in synaptic expression and function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the brain remain mostly unknown because of the neonatal lethality of global knock-out mice. To address this, we generated conditional knock-out mice, in which GluN2B was ablated exclusively in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. By immunohistochemistry, GluN2B disappeared and GluN1 (GluRζ1/NR1) was moderately reduced, whereas GluN2A (GluRε1/NR2A) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) were unaltered in the mutant CA3. This was consistent with protein contents in the CA3 crude fraction: 9.6\% of control level for GluN2B, 47.7\% for GluN1, 90.6\% for GluN2A, and 98.0\% for PSD-95. Despite the remaining NMDARs, NMDAR-mediated currents and long-term potentiation were virtually lost at various CA3 synapses. Then, we compared synaptic NMDARs by postembedding immunogold electron microscopy and immunoblot using the PSD fraction. In the mutant CA3, GluN1 was severely reduced in both immunogold (20.6-23.6\%) and immunoblot (24.6\%), whereas GluN2A and PSD-95 were unchanged in immunogold but markedly reduced in the PSD fraction (51.4 and 36.5\%, respectively), indicating increased detergent solubility of PSD molecules. No such increased solubility was observed for GluN2B in the CA3 of GluN2A-knock-out mice. Furthermore, significant decreases were found in the ratio of filamentous to globular actin (49.5\%) and in the density of dendritic spines (76.2\%). These findings suggest that GluN2B is critically involved in NMDAR channel function, organization of postsynaptic macromolecular complexes, formation or maintenance of dendritic spines, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.},

These and similar issues have been addressed through several decades of scientometric research. This article provides an overview of some of the main issues at stake, including theories of citation and the interpretation and validity of citations as performance measures. Research quality is a multidimensional concept, where plausibility/soundness, originality, scientific value, and societal value commonly are perceived as key characteristics. The article investigates how citations may relate to these various research quality dimensions. It is argued that citations reflect aspects related to scientific impact and relevance, although with important limitations. On the contrary, there is no evidence that citations reflect other key dimensions of research quality. Hence, an increased use of citation indicators in research evaluation and funding may imply less attention to these other research quality dimensions, such as solidity/plausibility, originality, and societal value.},

In the central nervous system (CNS), LTP has been recorded at numerous synapses and is a prime candidate mechanism associating activity-dependent plasticity with learning and memory. LTP involves long-lasting increase in synaptic strength with various underlying mechanisms. In the CNS, the predominant type of LTP is believed to be dependent on activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is highly calcium-permeable. However, various forms of NMDAR-independent LTP have been identified in diverse areas of the nervous system. The NMDAR-independent LTP may require activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) or ionotropic receptors other than NMDAR such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor or calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR). In this review, NMDAR-independent LTP of various areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {Historically, educators in higher education (HE) were expected to educate, generate knowledge, and do community service. With some commentators arguing that an academic must ‘publish or perish’, the expectation to create knowledge through research became overemphasized. The concept is widespread in HE institutions around the world. It aids to keep staff, particularly those in universities, constantly engaged with relevant knowledge works in their fields of expertise. According to this viewpoint, research publications are the most important factor in determining whether an academic or an administrator gets employed, promoted, acknowledged, retained, or not hired. The idea of ‘publish or perish’, on the other hand, is based on the dominant Western knowledge creation realities, which largely misrepresent or ignore African realities. To avoid perpetuating inequalities in academia, it is critical to re-examine how this idea informs knowledge creation in Africa. For example, the enormous number of publications required for one to advance up the academic ladder comes at a hefty cost that is not always feasible to low-paid academics in Africa’s resource-poor countries. This limits promotion of some individuals. Basically, for many Africans, what matters is the information gained, not how many times one’s work is acknowledged in scholarly publications. We need to establish knowledge-creation processes that are tailored to African realities. To that goal, we must strike a balance between having numerous publications with the potential to have an impact on society, given that developing solutions to development concerns appears to be more vital for Africa right now. This paper problematizes the ‘publish or perish’ concept for African academics, especially those intending to make an impact in their society with a purpose of eliminating inequalities in academia.},

  abstract = {Because promotion and funding of physicians in academic medicine are closely linked to the number of their publications, investigators feel impelled to publish as frequently as possible. This pressure leads to a number of unfortunate practices in medical publishing, including undertaking trivial studies because they yield rapid results, needlessly reporting the same study in installments, reporting a study more than once, and listing as authors people only marginally involved in the study. It may also be a motivation for fraud. An effective way to reduce these offenses and affirm the supremacy of substance over volume in scientific research would be to place a ceiling on the number of publications that can be considered in evaluating a candidate for promotion or funding. Each publication would then receive commensurately more attention, both from the researcher and from those judging the work.},

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of orexin-A on the performance of Wistar rats during the Morris water maze test and then to determine the effects of orexin-A on both the long-term potentiation and long-term depression in Schaffer collateral/commissural-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. The results of the Morris water maze test show that 1.0 and 10 nmol of orexin-A, when administered intracerebroventricularly, retarded spatial learning. A probe test examined after training of water maze task also showed an impairment in spatial memory. The results of an electrophysiological study using hippocampal slices demonstrated that 1.0 to 30 nM of orexin-A applied to the perfusate produces a dose-dependent and time dependent suppression of the long-term potentiation. In addition, the long-term depression was not affected by orexin-A. The results of a paired-pulse facilitation experiment indicated that the effects of orexin-A were post-synaptic and not due to presynaptic transmitter release. These results show that orexin-A impairs spatial performance and these impairments can be attributed to a suppression of long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 hippocampal synapses.},

  abstract = {CaMKII is a protein kinase whose function is regulated by the binding of the Calcium/Calmodulin complex (Ca2+/CaM). It is a major player in the Long Term Potentiation process where it acts as a molecular switch, oscillating between inhibited and active conformations. The mechanism for the switching is thought to be initiated by Ca2+/CaM binding, which allows the trans-phosphorylation of a subunit of CaMKII by a neighboring kinase, leading to the active state of the system. A combination of all-atom and coarse-grained MD simulations with free energy calculations, led us to reveal an interplay of electrostatic forces exerted by Ca2+/CaM on CaMKII, which initiate the activation process. The highly electrically charged Ca2+/CaM neutralizes basic regions in the linker domain of CaMKII, facilitating its opening and consequent activation. The emerging picture of CaMKII’s behavior highlights the preponderance of electrostatic interactions, which are modulated by the presence of Ca2+/CaM and the phosphorylation of key sites.},

We present an effort-analysis method that derives tool usage statistics and developer actions from a project's change history (version control system) and uses a novel effort estimation algorithm to quantify the effort savings attributable to tool usage. We apply this method to assess the impact of a software tool called VE, a version-sensitive editor used in Bell Labs. VE aids software developers in coping with the rampant use of certain preprocessor directives (similar to \#if/\#endif in C source files). Our analysis found that developers were approximately 40 percent more productive when using VE than when using standard text editors.},

In support of this, both hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning in a watermaze are impaired by blocking NMDA receptors with a selective antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5)4 or by a mutation in one of the receptor subunits5. Here we report, however, that the AP5-induced learning deficit can be almost completely prevented if rats are pretrained in a different watermaze before administration of the drug. This is not because of stimulus generalization, and occurs despite learning of the second task remaining hippocampus dependent. An A PS5-induced learning deficit is, however, still seen if the animals are pretrained using a non-spatial task. Thus, despite its procedural simplicity, the watermaze may involve multiple cognitive processes with distinct pharmacological properties; although required for some component of spatial learning, NMDA receptors may not be required for encoding the spatial representation of a specific environment.},

  abstract = {Synaptic receptors in the human brain consist of multiple protein subunits, many of which have multiple variants, coded by different genes, and are differentially expressed across brain regions and developmental stages. The brain can tune the electrophysiological properties of synapses to regulate plasticity and information processing by switching from one protein variant to another. Such condition-dependent variant switch during development has been demonstrated in several neurotransmitter systems including NMDA and GABA. Here we systematically detect pairs of receptor-subunit variants that switch during the lifetime of the human brain by analyzing postmortem expression data collected in a population of donors at various ages and brain regions measured using microarray and RNA-seq. To further detect variant pairs that co-vary across subjects, we present a method to quantify age-corrected expression correlation in face of strong temporal trends. This is achieved by computing the correlations in the residual expression beyond a cubic-spline model of the population temporal trend, and can be seen as a nonlinear version of partial correlations. Using these methods, we detect multiple new pairs of context dependent variants. For instance, we find a switch from GLRA2 to GLRA3 that differs from the known switch in the rat. We also detect an early switch from HTR1A to HTR5A whose trends are negatively correlated and find that their age-corrected expression is strongly positively correlated. Finally, we observe that GRIN2B switch to GRIN2A occurs mostly during embryonic development, presumably earlier than observed in rodents. These results provide a systematic map of developmental switching in the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain.},

Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

  abstract = {Binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B is an important control mechanism for the regulation of synaptic strength. CaMKII binding to GluN2B and CaMKII translocation to synapses are induced by an initial Ca2+/CaM stimulus, which also activates the kinase. Indeed, several mechanistically different CaMKII inhibitors [tatCN21 and KN-93 (N-[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-propen\hspace{0pt}yl]methylamino]methyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4\hspace{0pt}-methoxybenzenesulphonamide)] and inactivating mutations (K42M, A302R, and T305/T306D) impair this interaction, suggesting that it requires CaMKII enzymatic activity. However, this study shows that two general kinase inhibitors, H7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine] and staurosporine (Sta), which inhibit CaMKII activity by yet another mechanism, did not interfere with GluN2B binding in vitro or within cells. In contrast to a previous report, we found that Sta, like H7, inhibited CaMKII in an ATP-competitive manner. Nucleotide binding significantly enhances CaMKII/GluN2B binding in vitro, but the nucleotide competition by H7 or Sta did not prevent this effect and instead even mimicked it. H7 (700 µM) and Sta (2 µM) efficiently blocked enzymatic activity of CaMKII, both in vitro and within cells. However, neither H7 nor Sta prevented Ca2+-induced translocation of CaMKII to GluN2B in heterologous cells or to synapses in hippocampal neurons. Thus, activity of CaMKII (or of any other kinase inhibited by H7 or Sta) is not required for stimulation-induced GluN2B-binding or synaptic translocation of CaMKII, despite previous indication to the contrary. This shows that results with inhibitors and inhibiting mutants can be caused by structural effects independent from catalytic activity, and that detailed understanding of the mechanisms is required for their interpretation.},

  abstract = {A hallmark feature of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is generation of autonomous (Ca2+-independent) activity by T286 autophosphorylation. Biochemical studies have shown that “autonomous” CaMKII is ∼5-fold further stimulated by Ca2+/CaM, but demonstration of a physiological function for such regulation within cells has remained elusive. In this study, CaMKII-induced enhancement of synaptic strength in rat hippocampal neurons required both autonomous activity and further stimulation. Synaptic strength was decreased by CaMKIIα knockdown and rescued by reexpression, but not by mutants impaired for autonomy (T286A) or binding to NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B; formerly NR2B; I205K). Full rescue was seen with constitutively autonomous mutants (T286D), but only if they could be further stimulated (additional T305/306A mutation), and not with two other mutations that additionally impair Ca2+/CaM binding. Compared to rescue with wild-type CaMKII, the CaM-binding-impaired mutants even had reduced synaptic strength. One of these mutants (T305/306D) mimicked an inhibitory autophosphorylation of CaMKII, whereas the other one (Δstim) abolished CaM binding without introducing charged residues. Inhibitory T305/306 autophosphorylation also reduced GluN2B binding, but this effect was independent of reduced Ca2+/CaM binding and was not mimicked by T305/306D mutation. Thus, even autonomous CaMKII activity must be further stimulated by Ca2+/CaM for enhancement of synaptic strength.—Barcomb, K., Buard, I., Coultrap, S. J., Kulbe, J. R., O'Leary, H., Benke, T.

  abstract = {As the amount of biological data in the public domain grows, so does the range of modeling and analysis techniques employed in systems biology. In recent years, a number of theoretical computer science developments have enabled modeling methodology to keep pace. The growing interest in systems biology in executable models and their analysis has necessitated the borrowing of terms and methods from computer science, such as formal analysis, model checking, static analysis, and runtime verification. Here, we discuss the most important and exciting computational methods and tools currently available to systems biologists. We believe that a deeper understanding of the concepts and theory highlighted in this review will produce better software practice, improved investigation of complex biological processes, and even new ideas and better feedback into computer science.},

  abstract = {We have built a stochastic model in the program MCell that simulates Ca2+ transients in spines from the principal molecular components believed to control Ca2+ entry and exit. Proteins, with their kinetic models, are located within two segments of dendrites containing 88 intact spines, centered in a fully reconstructed 6 × 6 × 5 μm3 cube of hippocampal neuropil. Protein components include AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, L- and R-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases, smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases, immobile Ca2+ buffers, and calbindin. Kinetic models for each protein were taken from published studies of the isolated proteins in vitro. For simulation of electrical stimuli, the time course of voltage changes in the dendritic spine was generated with the desired stimulus in the program NEURON. Voltage-dependent parameters were then continuously re-adjusted during simulations in MCell to reproduce the effects of the stimulus. Nine parameters of the model were optimized within realistic experimental limits by a process that compared results of simulations to published data. We find that simulations in the optimized model reproduce the timing and amplitude of Ca2+ transients measured experimentally in intact neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that the characteristics of individual isolated proteins determined in vitro can accurately reproduce the dynamics of experimentally measured Ca2+ transients in spines. The model will provide a test bed for exploring the roles of additional proteins that regulate Ca2+ influx into spines and for studying the behavior of protein targets in the spine that are regulated by Ca2+ influx.},

More importantly, Dr. R. Barker Bausell has designed it to provide guidance to practicing and aspiring scientists regarding how (a) to change the way in which science has come to be both conducted and reported in order to avoid producing false positive, irreproducible results in their own work and (b) to change those institutional practices (primarily but not exclusively involving the traditional journal publishing process and the academic reward system) that have unwittingly contributed to the present crisis.

  abstract = {Ca2+ oscillations are required in various signal trans duction pathways, and contain information both in their amplitude and frequency. Remarkably, the Ca2+/calmodulin(CaM)‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can decode such frequencies. A Ca2+/CaM‐stimulated autophosphorylation leads to Ca2+/CaM‐independent (autonomous) activity of the kinase that outlasts the initial stimulation. This autonomous activity increases exponentially with the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Here we show that three β‐CaMKII splice variants (βM, β and βe′) have very similar specific activity and maximal autonomy. However, their autonomy generated by Ca2+ oscillations differs significantly. A mechanistic basis was found in alterations of the CaM activation constant and of the initial rate of autophosphorylation. Structurally, the splice variants differ only in a variable ‘linker’ region between the kinase and association domains. Therefore, we propose that differences in relative positioning of kinase domains within multimeric holoenzymes are responsible for the observed effects. Notably, the β‐CaMKII splice variants are differ entially expressed, even among individual hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that alternative splicing provides cells with a mechanism to modulate their sensitivity to Ca2+ oscillations.},

However, current mechanistic models require fundamental revision. CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 (pThr286) does not provide the molecular basis for long-term memory, as long believed. Instead, pThr286 mediates the signal processing required for induction of several distinct forms of synaptic plasticity, including Hebbian long-term potentiation and depression and non-Hebbian behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity. We discuss (i) the molecular computations by which CaMKII supports these diverse plasticity mechanisms, (ii) alternative CaMKII mechanisms that may contribute to the maintenance phase of LTP and (iii) the relationship of these mechanisms to behavioral learning and memory.},

  abstract = {Activity-dependent plasticity is a fundamental feature of most CNS synapses and is thought to be a synaptic correlate of memory in rodents. In humans, NMDA receptors have been linked to verbal memory processes, but it is unclear whether NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity can be recruited for information storage in the human CNS. Here we have for the first time analyzed different forms of synaptic plasticity in human hippocampus. In human subjects who show a morphologically intact hippocampus that is not the primary seizure focus, NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and forskolin-induced long-lasting potentiation are readily induced at the perforant path–dentate gyrus synapse. In this group, long-term potentiation could be partially depotentiated by low-frequency stimulation. Because patients with a hippocampal seizure focus showed a marked reduction in verbal memory performance in previous studies, we asked whether synaptic plasticity is similarly affected by the presence of a hippocampal primary seizure focus. We found that the amount of potentiation induced by high-frequency stimulation or perfusion of forskolin is dramatically reduced in this patient group. In addition, low-frequency stimulation is not effective in inducing synaptic depression. In summary, we show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity with properties similar to the rodent is available for information storage in the human hippocampus. Because both verbal memory processes and synaptic plasticity are impaired by a hippocampal seizure focus, we suggest that impaired synaptic plasticity may contribute to deficient declarative memory in human temporal lobe epilepsy.},

  abstract = {The influences of stimulus intensity, intratrain frequency, and number of trains were studied for their effects on the development of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal formation. LTP was analyzed with full input-output curves for population spike (PS) amplitudes (PS-LTP) calculated from responses elicited in the CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus by monosynaptic activation. A standardized protocol employing a sequence of stimuli was devised to systematically compare LTP in the dentate gyrus to that in the CA1 region in rats of various ages ranging from postnatal day (PN) 6 to adults (PN 60). In adult animals, the degrees of LTP were comparable in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region for the 3 stimulus strengths studied (intensity just subthreshold for PS, intensity giving 14 maximal PS, and intensity giving 12 maximal PS). LTP developed at different rates in the two regions, reaching adult values about two weeks after birth in CA1 but about 3 weeks after birth in the dentate gyrus. We postulate that differences in the rate of development in CA1 and in the dentate gyrus are related to the later neurogenesis of dentate granule cells and also possibly to a later functional maturation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-channel complexes on these cells.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses can undergo postsynaptically expressed long-term depression (LTD) or long-term potentiation (LTP). PF-LTD induction requires the coactivity of the PF and CF (climbing fiber) inputs to PCs and a concomitant calcium transient and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). PF-LTP can be induced by PF activity alone and requires a lower calcium transient for its induction than PF-LTD. The cellular events triggering PF-LTP induction are not well characterized. At other types of synapses (e.g., in the hippocampus), bidirectional synaptic plasticity is under control of a kinase/phosphatase switch, with PKC and CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) activity promoting LTP induction and phosphatase activity promoting LTD induction. Here, we have tested for the involvement of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), PP2A, and PP2B (calcineurin) in cerebellar LTP induction using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat cerebellar slices. LTP induction was blocked in the presence of the PP1/2A inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin LR, the PP1 inhibitory peptide inhibitor-2, the PP2A inhibitor fostriecin, and the PP2B inhibitor cyclosporin A. LTP induction was not impaired by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Conversely, LTD induction was not blocked by microcystin LR but instead was reduced when active PP2B was injected into PCs. These data indicate that a kinase/phosphatase switch controls bidirectional cerebellar plasticity, but in a manner “inverse” to the dependencies found at other types of synapses. Therefore, cerebellar LTP constitutes the only form of LTP described so far that depends on phosphatase rather than kinase activity.},

  abstract = {A calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been purified from rat brain. It was monitored during the purification by its ability to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synapsin I. A 300-fold purification was sufficient to produce kinase that is 90-95\% pure as determined by scans of stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has a specific activity of 2.9 mumol of 32P transferred per min/mg of protein. Thus, the kinase is a relatively abundant brain enzyme, perhaps comprising as much as 0.3\% of the total brain protein. The Stokes radius (95 A) and sedimentation coefficient (16.4 S) of the kinase indicate a holoenzyme molecular weight of approximately 650,000. The holoenzyme is composed of three subunits as judged by their co-migration with kinase activity during the purification steps and co-precipitation with kinase activity by a specific anti-kinase monoclonal antibody. The three subunits have molecular weights of 50,000, 58,000, and 60,000, and have been termed alpha, beta', and beta, respectively. The alpha- and beta-subunits are distinct peptides, however, beta' may have been generated from beta by proteolysis. All three of these subunits bind calmodulin in the presence of calcium and are autophosphorylated under conditions in which the kinase is active. The subunits are present in a ratio of about 3 alpha-subunits to 1 beta/beta'-subunit. We therefore postulate that the 650,000-Da holoenzyme consists of approximately 9 alpha-subunits and 3 beta/beta'-subunits. The abundance of this calmodulin-dependent protein kinase indicates that its activation is likely to be an important biochemical response to increases in calcium ion concentration in neuronal tissue.},

To answer these questions, some general tips are here suggested to choose the proper modeling approach according to the size of the system, the desired level of detail for the system description, the availability of experimental data and the computational costs of the analyses that the model will require. The attention is then focused on the numerous advantages of reaction-based modeling, such as its high level of detail and easy understandability, or the possibility to run both deterministic and stochastic simulations exploiting the same model. Some notes on the computational methods required to analyze reaction-based models, as well as their parallelization on Graphics Processing Units, are finally provided.},

  abstract = {Background: Conflicting reports exist in the medical literature regarding the association between industry funding and published research findings. In this study, we examine the association between industry funding and the statistical significance of results in recently published medical and surgical trials. Methods: We examined a consecutive series of 332 randomized trials published between January 1999 and June 2001 in 8 leading surgical journals and 5 medical journals. Each eligible study was independently reviewed for methodological quality using a 21-point index with 5 domains: randomization, outcomes, eligibility criteria, interventions and statistical issues. Our primary analysis included studies that explicitly identified the primary outcome and reported it as statistically significant. For studies that did not explicitly identify a primary outcome, we defined a “positive” study as one with at least 1 statistically significant outcome measure. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine whether there was an association between reported industry funding and trial results, while controlling for study quality and sample size. Results: Among the 332 randomized trials, there were 158 drug trials, 87 surgical trials and 87 trials of other therapies. In 122 (37\%) of the trials, authors declared industry funding. An unadjusted analysis of this sample of trials revealed that industry funding was associated with a statistically significant result in favour of the new industry product (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–3.5). The association remained significant after adjustment for study quality and sample size (adjusted OR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.1–3.0). There was a nonsignificant difference between surgical trials (OR 8.0, 95\% CI 1.1–53.2) and drug trials (OR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.1–2.8), both of which were likely to have a pro-industry result (relative OR 5.0, 95\% CI 0.7–37.5, p = 0.14). Interpretation: Industry-funded trials are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings, both in medical trials and surgical interventions.},

  abstract = {Activation triggers the exchange of subunits in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an oligomeric enzyme that is critical for learning, memory, and cardiac function. The mechanism by which subunit exchange occurs remains elusive. We show that the human CaMKII holoenzyme exists in dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, and that the calmodulin (CaM)-binding element of CaMKII can bind to the hub of the holoenzyme and destabilize it to release dimers. The structures of CaMKII from two distantly diverged organisms suggest that the CaM-binding element of activated CaMKII acts as a wedge by docking at intersubunit interfaces in the hub. This converts the hub into a spiral form that can release or gain CaMKII dimers. Our data reveal a three-way competition for the CaM-binding element, whereby phosphorylation biases it towards the hub interface, away from the kinase domain and calmodulin, thus unlocking the ability of activated CaMKII holoenzymes to exchange dimers with unactivated ones.},

CaMKII activity depends on the balance between activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation (on Thr 286 and Thr 305/306, respectively, in the human α isoform). Variation in the linkers could alter transphosphorylation rates within a holoenzyme and the balance of autophosphorylation outcomes. We show, using mammalian cell expression and a single-molecule assay, that the balance of autophosphorylation is flipped between CaMKII variants with longer and shorter linkers. For the principal isoforms in the brain, CaMKII-α, with a \textasciitilde 30 residue linker, readily acquires activating autophosphorylation, while CaMKII-β, with a \textasciitilde 200 residue linker, is biased towards inhibitory autophosphorylation. Our results show how the responsiveness of CaMKII holoenzymes to calcium signals can be tuned by varying the relative levels of isoforms with long and short linkers.},

This study focuses on summarizing and extending current knowledge about green OA. A synthesis of previous studies indicates that green OA coverage of all published journal articles is approximately 12\%, with substantial disciplinary variation. Typically, green OA copies become available after considerable time delays, partly caused by publisher-imposed embargo periods, and partly by author tendencies to archive manuscripts only periodically. Although green OA copies should ideally be archived in proper repositories, a large share is stored on home pages and similar locations, with no assurance of long-term preservation. Often such locations contain exact copies of published articles, which may infringe on the publisher's exclusive rights. The technical foundation for green OA uploading is becoming increasingly solid largely due to the rapid increase in the number of institutional repositories. The number of articles within the scope of OA mandates, which strongly influence the self-archival rate of articles, is nevertheless still low.},

Single stimuli then commonly produced multiple discharges in the granule cell population. 4. After single periods of stimulation at 15/sec for 15–20 sec there was on 26\% of the occasions (41\% of those on which there was good frequency potentiation) a long-lasting potentiation of the responses to subsequent stimuli, lasting from 1 hr to 3 days. 5. After a further 20\% of the periods of repetitive stimulation there was a shorter lasting potentiation, and after 8\% there was a short lasting depression. 6. The potentiation, when present, was characterized by some or all of the following changes: increases in the amplitudes of the synaptic wave and population spike, reduction in the latency of the population spike, and reductions in the variability of the characteristics of the population spike. 7. During the long-lasting potentiation there was an increase in the excitability of the post-synaptic cells and, on some but not all occasions, an increase in the extracellular current flow produced directly by synaptic action.},

The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane. 2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10–20/sec for 10–15 sec, or 100/sec for 3–4 sec. 3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells. 4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments. 5. During conditioning at 10–20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (‘frequency potentiation’). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation. 6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long-term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics, and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which, in turn, are thought to activate both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {The paramount feature of long-term potentiation (LTP) as a memory mechanism is its characteristic persistence over time. Although the basic phenomenology of LTP persistence was established 30 years ago, new insights have emerged recently about the extent of LTP persistence and its regulation by activity and experience. Thus, it is now evident that LTP, at least in the dentate gyrus, can either be decremental, lasting from hours to weeks, or stable, lasting months or longer. Although mechanisms engaged during the induction of LTP regulate its subsequent persistence, the maintenance of LTP is also governed by activity patterns post-induction, whether induced experimentally or generated by experience. These new findings establish dentate gyrus LTP as a useful model system for studying the mechanisms governing the induction, maintenance and interference with long-term memory, including very long-term memory lasting months or longer. The challenge is to study LTP persistence in other brain areas, and to relate, if possible, the properties and regulation of LTP maintenance to these same properties of the information that is actually stored in those regions.},

In this article, some recent advances in this area made possible by the development of new imaging tools are summarized.

We first unpack what racially just methodologies and epistemologies have enquired from the late 1990s-2020, as well as where disability and coloniality have been represented (erased) in this work. Then, we engage with Mignolo’s seminal theorization of epistemic disobedience and its importance in the generation of our thesis. Finally, we make visible the need to conceptualize the margins within racially just enquiries that seek to disrupt whiteness in educational research by problematizing the ontological erasure of disability among these justice-oriented projects. We end by shifting from ‘what is’ toward ‘what if’ to envision radical possibilities for the future that disrupt mono-categorical enquiries seeking to challenge racism but invariably leave Othered identity nexuses undertheorized by design.},

  abstract = {Activity-dependent plasticity of synaptic structure and function plays an essential role in neuronal development and in cognitive functions including learning and memory. The formation, maintenance and modulation of dendritic spines are mainly controlled by the dynamics of actin filaments (F-actin) through interaction with various actin-binding proteins (ABPs) and postsynaptic signaling messengers. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) triggers a cascade of events involving Ca2+ signaling, intracellular pathways such as cAMP and cGMP, and regulation of ABPs such as CaMKII, Cofilin, Aip1, Arp2/3, α-actinin, Profilin and Drebrin. We review here how these ABPs modulate the rate of assembly, disassembly, stabilization and bundling of F-actin during LTP induction. We highlight the crucial role that CaMKII exerts in both functional and structural plasticity by directly coupling Ca2+ signaling with F-actin dynamics through the β subunit. Moreover, we show how cAMP and cGMP second messengers regulate postsynaptic structural potentiation. Brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or autism, are associated with alterations in the regulation of F-actin dynamics by these ABPs and signaling messengers. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling actin cytoskeleton can provide cues for the treatment of these disorders.},

This paper reviews literature on article processing charges (APCs) that has been published since 2000. Despite praise for diamond OA journals, which charge no fees, most OA articles are published by commercial publishers that charge APCs. Publishers fix APCs depending on the reputation assigned to journals by peers. Evidence shows a relationship between high impact metrics and higher, faster rising APCs. Authors express reluctance about APCs, although this varies by discipline depending on previous experience of paying publication fees and the availability of research grants to cover them. Authors rely on a mix of research grants, library funds and personal assets to pay the charges. Two major concerns have been raised in relation to APCs: the inability of poorly funded authors to publish research and their impact on journal quality. Waivers have not solved the first issue. Research shows little extension of waiver use, unintended side effects on co-author networks and concerns regarding criteria to qualify for them. Bibliometric studies concur that journals that charge APCs have a similar citation impact to journals that rely on other income sources.},

This potentiation can be divided into an early decremental component, known as short-term potentiation (STP), and a more slowly developing persistent phase, termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we describe how activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), by aminocyclopentane-1S,3R-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), can induce the same stable form of LTP, but without the STP component. 1S,3R-ACPD-induced LTP does not require electrical stimulation during its induction, but is dependent on an intact connection between the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. 1S,3R-ACPD-induced LTP circumvents the need for the activation of NMDA receptors and is likely to involve both the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.},

We argue that, in this approach, modeling is akin to programming and can likewise benefit from an integrated development environment. Our platform is a step in this direction.We discuss details about the computation and rendering of static, dynamic, and causal views of a model, which include the contact map (CM), snaphots at different resolutions, the dynamic influence network (DIN) and causal compression. We provide use cases illustrating how these concepts generate insight. Specifically, we show how the CM and snapshots provide information about systems capable of polymerization, such as Wnt signaling. A well-understood model of the KaiABC oscillator, translated into Kappa from the literature, is deployed to demonstrate the DIN and its use in understanding systems dynamics. Finally, we discuss how pathways might be discovered or recovered from a rule-based model by means of causal compression, as exemplified for early events in EGF signaling.The Kappa platform is available via the project website at kappalanguage.org.

We demonstrate that BioDynaMo can be used to simulate use cases in: neuroscience, oncology and epidemiology. For each use case, we validate our findings with experimental data or an analytical solution. Our performance results show that BioDynaMo performs up to three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art baselines.

Using single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we show that α- and β-CaM kinase II mRNAs are simultaneously present in the majority of hippocampal neurons examined and that co-assembly of their protein products into heteromers is therefore possible. The subunit composition of CaM kinase II holoenzymes was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies. Rat forebrain CaM kinase II consists of heteromers composed of α and β subunits at a ratio of 2:1 and homomers composed of only α subunits. We examined the functional effect of the heteromeric assembly by analyzing the calmodulin dependence of autophosphorylation. Recombinant homomers of α- or β-CaM kinase II, as well as of alternatively spliced β isoforms, have distinct calmodulin dependences for autophosphorylation based on differences in their calmodulin affinities. Half-maximal autophosphorylation of α is achieved at 130 nmcalmodulin, while that for β occurs at 15 nm calmodulin. In CaM kinase II isolated from rat forebrain, however, the calmodulin dependence for autophosphorylation of the β subunits is shifted toward that of α homomers. This suggests that Thr\textsuperscript{287} in β subunits is phosphorylated by α subunits present in the same holoenzyme. Once autophosphorylated, β-CaM kinase II traps calmodulin by reducing the rate of calmodulin dissociation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Models cannot replace experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in a given situation. But they can demonstrate whether or not a proposed mechanism is sufficient to produce an observed phenomenon.

  abstract = {The fields of Neurobiology and Neuromodulation have never been closer. Consequently, the phrase “synaptic plasticity” has become very familiar to non-basic scientists, without actually being very familiar. We present the “Story of the AMPA receptor,” an easy-to-understand “10,000 ft” narrative overview of synaptic plasticity, oriented toward the brain stimulation clinician or scientist without basic science training. Neuromodulation is unparalleled in its capacity to both modulate and probe plasticity, yet many are not comfortable with their grasp of the topic. Here, we describe the seminal discoveries that defined the canonical mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and homeostatic plasticity. We then provide a conceptual framework for how plasticity at the synapse is accomplished, describing the functional roles of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and calcium, their effect on calmodulin, phosphatases (ie, calcineurin), kinases (ie, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase [CaMKII]), and structural “scaffolding” proteins (ie, post-synaptic density protein [PSD-95]). Ultimately, we describe how these affect the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor. More specifically, AMPA receptor delivery to (LTP induction), removal from (LTD), or recycling within (LTP maintenance) the synapse is determined by the status of phosphorylation and protein binding at specific sites on the tails of AMPA receptor subunits: GluA1 and GluA2. Finally, we relate these to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment, highlighting evidences for LTP as the basis of high-frequency TMS therapy, and briefly touch on the role of plasticity for other brain stimulation modalities. In summary, we present Synaptic Plasticity 101 as a singular introductory reference for those less familiar with the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) “autonomy” (T286-autophosphorylation-induced Ca2+-independent activity) is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and for learning and memory, as demonstrated by CaMKII T286A mutant mice. The {$>$}20-year-old hypothesis that CaMKII stimulation is required for LTP induction, while CaMKII autonomy is required for LTP maintenance was recently supported using the cell-penetrating fusion-peptide inhibitor antCN27. However, we demonstrate here that ant/penetratin fusion to CN27 compromised CaMKII-selectivity, by enhancing a previously unnoticed direct binding of CaM to ant/penetratin. In contrast to antCN27, the improved cell-penetrating inhibitor tatCN21 (5 μm) showed neither CaM binding nor inhibition of basal synaptic transmission. In vitro, tatCN21 inhibited stimulated and autonomous CaMKII activity with equal potency. In rat hippocampal slices, tatCN21 inhibited LTP induction, but not LTP maintenance. Correspondingly, tatCN21 also inhibited learning, but not memory storage or retrieval in a mouse in vivo model. Thus, CaMKII autonomy provides a short-term molecular memory that is important in the signal computation leading to memory formation, but is not required as long-term memory store.},

Here, we provide a comparative analysis of these signaling devices, using single-particle electron microscopy (EM) in combination with biochemical and live-cell imaging studies. In the basal state, both isoforms assemble mainly as 12-mers (but also 14-mers and even 16-mers for the β isoform). CaMKIIα and β isoforms adopt an ensemble of extended activatable states (with average radius of 12.6 versus 16.8 nm, respectively), characterized by multiple transient intra- and inter-holoenzyme interactions associated with distinct functional properties. The extended state of CaMKIIβ allows direct resolution of intra-holoenzyme kinase domain dimers. These dimers could enable cooperative activation by calmodulin, which is observed for both isoforms. High-order CaMKII clustering mediated by inter-holoenzyme kinase domain dimerization is reduced for the β isoform for both basal and excitotoxicity-induced clusters, both in vitro and in neurons., The CaMKII holoenzyme enables neuronal signal computation. In a comparative structure-function analysis of the neuronal α and β isoforms, Buonarati et al. find evidence for kinase domain dimers within the holoenzyme that enable a cooperative activation mechanism in both isoforms and inter-holoenzyme interactions that enable high-order aggregate formation under ischemic conditions.,},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the Cellular Dynamic Simulator (CDS) for simulating diffusion and chemical reactions within crowded molecular environments. CDS is based on a novel event driven algorithm specifically designed for precise calculation of the timing of collisions, reactions and other events for each individual molecule in the environment. Generic mesh based compartments allow the creation / importation of very simple or detailed cellular structures that exist in a 3D environment. Multiple levels of compartments and static obstacles can be used to create a dense environment to mimic cellular boundaries and the intracellular space. The CDS algorithm takes into account volume exclusion and molecular crowding that may impact signaling cascades in small sub-cellular compartments such as dendritic spines. With the CDS, we can simulate simple enzyme reactions; aggregation, channel transport, as well as highly complicated chemical reaction networks of both freely diffusing and membrane bound multi-protein complexes. Components of the CDS are generally defined such that the simulator can be applied to a wide range of environments in terms of scale and level of detail. Through an initialization GUI, a simple simulation environment can be created and populated within minutes yet is powerful enough to design complex 3D cellular architecture. The initialization tool allows visual confirmation of the environment construction prior to execution by the simulator. This paper describes the CDS algorithm, design implementation, and provides an overview of the types of features available and the utility of those features are highlighted in demonstrations.},

  abstract = {We used a particle-based Monte Carlo simulation to dissect the regulatory mechanism of molecular translocation of CaMKII, a key regulator of neuronal synaptic function. Geometry was based upon measurements from EM reconstructions of dendrites in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Three types of simulations were performed to investigate the effects of geometry and other mechanisms that control CaMKII translocation in and out of dendritic spines. First, the diffusional escape rate of CaMKII from model spines of varied morphologies was examined. Second, a postsynaptic density (PSD) was added to study the impact of binding sites on this escape rate. Third, translocation of CaMKII from dendrites and trapping in spines was investigated using a simulated dendrite. Based on diffusion alone, a spine of average dimensions had the ability to retain CaMKII for duration of \textasciitilde 4~s. However, binding sites mimicking those in the PSD controlled the residence time of CaMKII in a highly nonlinear manner. In addition, we observed that F-actin at the spine head/neck junction had a significant impact on CaMKII trapping in dendritic spines. We discuss these results in the context of possible mechanisms that may explain the experimental results that have shown extended accumulation of CaMKII in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity and LTP induction.},

Inhibition of adult neurogenesis produces some behavioral impairments that suggest a role for new neurons in learning and memory; however, other behavioral changes appear inconsistent with this function. A review of studies investigating the function of the hippocampus going back several decades reveals many ideas that seem to converge on a critical role for the hippocampus in stress response and emotion. These potential hippocampal functions provide new avenues for investigating the behavioral functions of adult neurogenesis. And, conversely, studies in animals lacking adult neurogenesis, which are likely to have more limited and more specific impairments than are seen with lesions, may provide valuable new insights into the function of the hippocampus. A complete understanding of the function of the hippocampus must explain its role in emotion and the relationship between its emotional and memory functions.},

Although some convergence is preferred to none, this study demonstrates that even modest departures from perfect convergent validity can result in substantial differences in the magnitudes of findings, creating challenges for the accumulation and interpretation of research. Using data from published research, the authors find that substantial differences in findings between studies using desired and proxy variables occur even at levels of convergent validity as high as r = .85. Implications of using measures with less-than-ideal convergent validity for the interpretability of research results are examined. Convergent validities above r = .70 are recommended, whereas those below r = .50 should be avoided. Researchers are encouraged to develop and report convergent validity data.},

Evidence produced in and about the global North is assumed to be more “universal,” whereas evidence from or produced in the global South is considered valid only for specific contexts (i.e., “localized”). We argue that these dynamics are evident in the phrasing of articles’ titles based on the examination of more than half a million social science research articles indexed by Scopus (1996 to 2020). We find that empirical articles written by authors affiliated to institutions of the global North, using data from these countries, are less likely to include a concrete geographical reference in their titles. When authors are affiliated to global South institutions, and use evidence from global South countries, the names of these countries are more likely to be part of the article’s title. We confirm this overarching pattern by looking at 1) differences between world regions, 2) differences within world regions, and 3) patterns in 23 social science subfields. These gaps are large and consistent, yet article naming conventions are merely the “tip of the iceberg” of the imbalances in knowledge production between the global North and South.},

A 25-Hz tetanus induced a quickly developing potentiation that was blocked by the NMDA antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and was not affected by the L-type VDCC inhibitor nifedipine, suggesting that it was mediated by NMDA receptors (NMDA-LTP). 3. Application of a 200-Hz tetanus in APV induced a slowly developing NMDA-receptor-independent potentiation that was blocked by nifedipine and thus named VDCC-LTP. NMDA- and VDCC-LTP reached comparable magnitudes despite their different induction parameters and developmental kinetics. 4. Bath perfusion of the broad-spectrum serine/threonine kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) blocked NMDA-LTP but not VDCC-LTP, whereas the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and lavendustin A blocked VDCC-LTP but not NMDA-LTP. These results suggest a differential involvement of H-7-sensitive serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases in the two forms of LTP. 5. Tetanization of 200 Hz in control media resulted in a compound potentiation twice as large as NMDA- or VDCC-LTP, implying that the two forms of LTP did not facilitate or reduce each other's expression. The often-used 100-Hz tetanus (1 s twice) induced a potentiation that was comparable in size with the 200-Hz compound LTP. Nifedipine, genistein, and lavendustin A reduced the 100-Hz LTP by approximately 50\%, suggesting that this LTP is also a compound potentiation consisting of NMDA- and VDCC-mediated components and their corresponding signal transduction pathways.}

However, the properties of CaMKII that mediate Ca2+ signals in spines remain elusive. Here, we measured CaMKII activity in spines using fast-framing two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. Following each pulse during repetitive Ca2+ elevations, CaMKII activity increased in a stepwise manner. Thr286 phosphorylation slows the decay of CaMKII and thus lowers the frequency required to induce spine plasticity by several fold. In the absence of Thr286 phosphorylation, increasing the stimulation frequency results in high peak mutant CaMKIIT286A activity that is sufficient for inducing plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that Thr286 phosphorylation plays an important role in induction of LTP by integrating Ca2+ signals, and it greatly promotes, but is dispensable for, the activation of CaMKII and LTP.},

  abstract = {CaMKIIα plays an essential role in decoding Ca2+ signaling in spines by acting as a leaky Ca2+ integrator with the time constant of several seconds. However, the mechanism by which CaMKIIα integrates Ca2+ signals remains elusive. Here, we imaged CaMKIIα-CaM association in single dendritic spines using a new FRET sensor and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. In response to a glutamate uncaging pulse, CaMKIIα-CaM association increases in \textasciitilde 0.1\,s and decays over \textasciitilde 3\,s. During repetitive glutamate uncaging, which induces spine structural plasticity, CaMKIIα-CaM association did not show further increase but sustained at a constant level. Since CaMKIIα activity integrates Ca2+ signals over \textasciitilde 10\,s under this condition, the integration of Ca2+ signal by CaMKIIα during spine structural plasticity is largely due to Ca2+/CaM-independent, autonomous activity. Based on these results, we propose a simple kinetic model of CaMKIIα activation in dendritic spines.},

Neither the structure of the dodecameric assembly nor how it regulates CaMKII are known. We present the crystal structure of an autoinhibited full-length human CaMKII holoenzyme, revealing an~unexpected compact arrangement of kinase domains docked against a central hub, with the calmodulin-binding sites completely inaccessible. We show that this compact docking is important for the autoinhibition of the kinase domains and for setting the calcium response of the holoenzyme. Comparison of CaMKII isoforms, which differ in the length of the linker between the kinase domain and the hub, demonstrates that these interactions can be strengthened or weakened by changes in linker length. This equilibrium between autoinhibited states provides a simple mechanism for tuning the calcium response without changes in either the hub or the kinase domains. PaperFlick},

AMPARs, which are enriched in the postsynaptic membrane on dendritic spines, are highly dynamic, and shuttle in and out of synapses in an activity-dependent manner. Changes in their number, subunit composition, phosphorylation state, and accessory proteins can all regulate AMPARs and thus modify synaptic strength and support cellular forms of learning. Furthermore, dysregulation of AMPAR plasticity has been implicated in various pathological states and has important consequences for mental health.

  abstract = {The primate temporal cortex has been demonstrated to play an important role in visual memory and pattern recognition. It is of particular interest to investigate whether activity-dependent modification of synaptic efficacy, a presumptive mechanism for learning and memory, is present in this cortical region. Here we address this issue by examining the induction of synaptic plasticity in surgically resected human inferior and middle temporal cortex. The results show that synaptic strength in the human temporal cortex could undergo bidirectional modifications, depending on the pattern of conditioning stimulation. High frequency stimulation (100 or 40 Hz) in layer IV induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of both intracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials and evoked field potentials in layers II/III. The LTP induced by 100 Hz tetanus was blocked by 50-100 microM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, suggesting that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were responsible for its induction. Long-term depression (LTD) was elicited by prolonged low frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 15 min). It was reduced, but not completely blocked, by DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, implying that some other mechanisms in addition to N-methyl-DL-aspartate receptors were involved in LTD induction. LTD was input-specific, i.e., low frequency stimulation of one pathway produced LTD of synaptic transmission in that pathway only. Finally, the LTP and LTD could reverse each other, suggesting that they can act cooperatively to modify the functional state of cortical network. These results suggest that LTP and LTD are possible mechanisms for the visual memory and pattern recognition functions performed in the human temporal cortex.},

PSDs had a mean diameter of 360 nm and molecular mass of 1.10 ± 0.36 GDa. Because the mass represents the sum of the molecular masses of all of the molecules comprising a PSD, it becomes possible to derive the number of copies of each protein, once its relative mass contribution is known. Mass contributions of PSD-95, synapse-associated protein (SAP)97, and α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were determined by quantitative gel electrophoresis of PSD fractions. The number of PSD-95 molecules per average PSD, contributing 2.3\% of the mass of the PSD, was calculated to be 300, whereas the number of SAP97 molecules, contributing 0.9\% of the mass of the PSD, was 90. The α-CaMKII holoenzymes, which contribute 6\% of the mass when brains are homogenized within 2 min of interrupting blood flow, have 80 holoenzymes associated with a typical PSD. When blood flow is interrupted 15 min before homogenization, the average mass of PSDs increases by ≈40\%. The additional α-CaMKII associated with PSDs accounts for up to 20\% of this mass increase, representing the addition of 100–200 α-CaMKII holoenzymes.},

Biochemical studies indicate that CaMKII catalyzes a phosphotransferase (kinase) reaction of both itself (autophosphorylation) and of multiple downstream target proteins. However, whether either type of phosphorylation plays any role in the synaptic enhancing action of CaMKII remains hotly contested. We have designed a series of experiments to define the minimal requirements for the synaptic enhancement by CaMKII. We find that autophosphorylation of T286 and further binding of CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit are required both for initiating LTP and for its maintenance (synaptic memory). Once bound to the NMDA receptor, the synaptic action of CaMKII occurs in the absence of target protein phosphorylation. Thus, autophosphorylation and binding to the GluN2B subunit are the only two requirements for CaMKII in synaptic memory.},

Sophisticated imaging techniques revealed that dendritic spines are complex structures consisting of a dense network of cytoskeletal, transmembrane and scaffolding molecules, and numerous surface receptors. Molecular signaling pathways, mainly Rho and Ras family small GTPases pathways that converge on actin cytoskeleton, regulate the spine morphology and dynamics bi-directionally during synaptic activity. During synaptic plasticity the number and shapes of dendritic spines undergo radical reorganizations. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induction promote spine head enlargement and the formation and stabilization of new spines. Long-term depression (LTD) results in their shrinkage and retraction. Reports indicate increased spine density in the pyramidal neurons of autism and Fragile X syndrome patients and reduced density in the temporal gyrus loci of schizophrenic patients. Post-mortem reports of Alzheimer’s brains showed reduced spine number in the hippocampus and cortex. This review highlights the spine morphogenesis process, the activity-dependent structural plasticity and mechanisms by which synaptic activity sculpts the dendritic spines, the structural and functional changes in spines during learning and memory using LTP and LTD processes. It also discusses on spine status in neurodegenerative diseases and the impact of nootropics and neuroprotective agents on the functional restoration of dendritic spines.},

The respective contributions of membrane recycling events and surface trafficking to setting AMPAR numbers at synapses have been the subject of intense debate. Although this discussion is not yet settled, it is safe to state that both categories of processes participate in receptor exchange at synapses at rest and during various forms of plasticity. More unexpectedly, AMPARs can diffuse at such high rates within the postsynaptic density itself that their surface trafficking could participate not only in setting receptor numbers at individual synapses but also in tuning synaptic transmission during short-term plasticity. I here review recent results that characterize the activity-dependent properties of AMPAR surface trafficking and their possible links to fast synaptic transmission.},

  abstract = {Rule-based modeling was developed to address the limitations of traditional approaches for modeling chemical kinetics in cell signaling systems. These systems consist of multiple interacting biomolecules (e.g., proteins), which themselves consist of multiple parts (e.g., domains, linear motifs, and sites of phosphorylation). Consequently, biomolecules that mediate information processing generally have the potential to interact in multiple ways, with the number of possible complexes and posttranslational modification states tending to grow exponentially with the number of binary interactions considered. As a result, only large reaction networks capture all possible consequences of the molecular interactions that occur in a cell signaling system, which is problematic because traditional modeling approaches for chemical kinetics (e.g., ordinary differential equations) require explicit network specification. This problem is circumvented through representation of interactions in terms of local rules. With this approach, network specification is implicit and model specification is concise. Concise representation results in a coarse graining of chemical kinetics, which is introduced because all reactions implied by a rule inherit the rate law associated with that rule. Coarse graining can be appropriate if interactions are modular, and the coarseness of a model can be adjusted as needed. Rules can be specified using specialized model-specification languages, and recently developed tools designed for specification of rule-based models allow one to leverage powerful software engineering capabilities. A rule-based model comprises a set of rules, which can be processed by general-purpose simulation and analysis tools to achieve different objectives (e.g., to perform either a deterministic or stochastic simulation).

We have cloned a member of a novel class of the rat ionotropic glutamate receptor family, termed chi-1. This subunit exhibits an average identity of 27\% to NMDA subunits and 23\% to non-NMDA subunits. Regional transcript levels of chi-1 are elevated just prior to and during the first postnatal week, with the highest levels present in the spinal cord, brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, CA1 field of the hippocampus, and amygdala. The spatial distribution of chi-1 expression is similar from postnatal day 1 (P1) to adulthood. However, transcript levels decline sharply between P7 and P14 and remain attenuated into adulthood. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed chi-1 RNA did not demonstrate agonist-activated currents. Pairwise expression of chi-1 with members of the AMPA, KA, or delta class of glutamate recepto subunits either failed to generate agonist-activated currents or failed to alter the underlying current generated by the coexpressed subunit. However, coexpression of chi-1 with subunits forming otherwise functional NMDA receptors resulted in an inhibition of current responses. Since chi-1 did not alter the currents generated by non-NMDA subunits, this suggests that chi-1 may specifically interact with NMDA receptor subunits. Further characterization will be required to establish the precise role of this glutamate receptor subunit in neuronal signaling.},

Commun. 173, 578-584) with EGTA, magnesium acetate, and [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the incorporation of up to 1.0 mol of 32PO4/mol of subunit within 60 min at 30 degrees C; both serine and threonine residues became autophosphorylated. The Vmax for this basal autophosphorylation was 0.051 +/- 0.005 mol of 32PO4/mol of subunit/min, and the Km(ATP) was 145 +/- 8 microM. Vmax and Km(ATP) values for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation were determined to be 1.3 +/- 0.4 mol/mol/min and 19 +/- 2 microM, respectively. Basal autophosphorylation resulted in inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity toward exogenous peptide substrate; there was no measurable increase in Ca(2+)-independent CaMKII activity. Inactivation was not observed following preincubation with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs in place of ATP. CaMKII that had been inactivated by basal autophosphorylation could be fully re-activated by incubation with the purified catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Following basal autophosphorylation, the calmodulin-binding ability of CaMKII was also reduced, presumably accounting for the observed inactivation. Both the inactivation and the decrease in calmodulin-binding that resulted from basal autophosphorylation were abrogated by mutation of threonine 306 to alanine, but not by mutation of threonine 305 to alanine. Furthermore, mutation of threonine 306, but not threonine 305, to alanine reduced the extent of basal autophosphorylation at threonine residues. Thus, basal autophosphorylation at threonine 306 blocks calmodulin binding, resulting in inactivation of CaMKII.},

  abstract = {Early Modern emblem books are primary sources for scholars studying the European Renaissance. Linked Open Data (LOD) is an approach for organizing and modeling information in a data-centric manner compatible with the emerging Semantic Web. The purpose of this paper is to examine ways in which LOD methods can be applied to facilitate emblem resource discovery, better reveal the structure and connectedness of digitized emblem resources, and enhance scholar interactions with digitized emblem resources.,This research encompasses an analysis of the existing XML-based Spine (emblem-specific) metadata schema; the design of a new, domain-specific, Resource Description Framework compatible ontology; the mapping and transformation of metadata from Spine to both the new ontology and (separately) to the pre-existing Schema.org ontology; and the (experimental) modification of the Emblematica Online portal as a proof of concept to illustrate enhancements supported by LOD.,LOD is viable as an approach for facilitating discovery and enhancing the value to scholars of digitized emblem books; however, metadata must first be enriched with additional uniform resource identifiers and the workflow upgrades required to normalize and transform existing emblem metadata are substantial and still to be fully worked out.,The research described demonstrates the feasibility of transforming existing, special collections metadata to LOD. Although considerable work and further study will be required, preliminary findings suggest potential benefits of LOD for both users and libraries.,This research is unique in the context of emblem studies and adds to the emerging body of work examining the application of LOD best practices to library special collections.},

  abstract = {1. The effects of excitatory amino acids and some antagonists applied by ionophoresis to stratum radiatum in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices were examined on the locally recorded field e.p.s.p. evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural projection. 2. L-glutamate, L-aspartate and the more potent and selective excitatory amino acids quisqualate, kainate and N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMA) depressed the e.p.s.p., presumably through depolarization and/or a change in membrane conductance. 3. The depression induced by kainate considerably outlasted the period of ejection whereas NMA depressions were rapidly reversible and were often followed by a potentiation of the e.p.s.p. In higher doses NMA also depressed the presynaptic fibre volley. The possible involvement of these effects in neurotoxicity and synaptic plasticity is raised. 4. The selective NMA antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) applied in doses which abolished responses to NMA, had no effect on the e.p.s.p. but prevented long term potentiation (l.t.p.) of synaptic transmission evoked by high frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. Other antagonists which had little or no effect on normal synaptic transmission included D-alpha-aminoadipate (DAA), the optical isomers of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) and L-glutamate diethylester (GDEE). 5. In contrast, gamma-D-glutamylglycine (DGG), applied in amounts which affected quisqualate and kainate actions as well as those of NMA, was an effective synaptic antagonist whilst having no effect on the presynaptic fibre volley. 6. These results indicate that the synaptic receptor in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway may be of the kainate or quisqualate type. Although NMA receptors do not appear to be involved in normal synaptic transmission in this pathway they may play a role in synaptic plasticity. The interaction of L-glutamate and L-aspartate with these receptors is discussed.},

Reflecting on an international study of academic publishing that has been framed within the lens of Southern theory, this article explores some of the issues facing those who work and publish in the global South, and offers an analysis of several of the mechanisms that assist to maintain the inequalities of the knowledge system. The focus then moves to an examination of some recent developments in academic publishing which challenge the dominance of the global North: the building of alternative transnational circuits of publishing that provide effective pathways for the distribution of academic knowledge from ‘inside the global South’.},

SCRNs have been widely used for describing naturally occurring (bio)chemical systems, and with the advent of synthetic biology they become a promising language for the design of artificial biochemical circuits. Our interest here is the computational power of SCRNs and how they relate to more conventional models of computation. We survey known connections and give new connections between SCRNs and Boolean Logic Circuits, Vector Addition Systems, Petri nets, Gate Implementability, Primitive Recursive Functions, Register Machines, Fractran, and Turing Machines. A theme to these investigations is the thin line between decidable and undecidable questions about SCRN behavior.},

Here we show that mGluR-dependent LTD also requires CaMKII and its T286 autophosphorylation (pT286), which induces Ca2+-independent autonomous kinase activity. In addition, we compared the role of pT286 among three forms of long-term plasticity (NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD, and mGluR-dependent LTD) using simultaneous live imaging of endogenous CaMKII together with synaptic marker proteins. We determined that after LTP stimuli, pT286 autophosphorylation accelerated CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. After NMDAR-LTD stimuli, pT286 was strictly required for any movement to inhibitory synapses. Similar to NMDAR-LTD, we found the mGluR-LTD stimuli did not induce CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. However, in contrast to NMDAR-LTD, we demonstrate that the mGluR-LTD did not involve CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses and did not require additional T305/306 autophosphorylation. Thus, despite its prominent role in LTP, we conclude that CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation is also required for both major forms of hippocampal LTD, albeit with differential requirements for the heterosynaptic communication of excitatory signals to inhibitory synapses.},

This hallmark feature of CaMKII regulation provides a form of molecular memory and is indeed important in long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapse strength and memory formation. However, emerging evidence supports a direct role in information processing, while storage of synaptic information may instead be mediated by regulated interaction of CaMKII with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) complex.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Both signaling by nitric oxide (NO) and by the Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II α isoform (CaMKIIα) are implicated in two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, as well as in excitotoxic/ischemic neuronal cell death. For CaMKIIα, these functions specifically involve also Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-independent autonomous activity, traditionally generated by Thr-286 autophosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that NO-induced \emph{S}-nitrosylation of CaMKIIα also directly generated autonomous activity, and that CaMKII inhibition protected from NO-induced neuronal cell death. NO induced \emph{S}-nitrosylation at Cys-280/289, and mutation of either site abolished autonomy, indicating that simultaneous nitrosylation at both sites was required. Additionally, autonomy was generated only when Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/CaM was present during NO exposure. Thus, generation of this form of CaMKIIα autonomy requires simultaneous signaling by NO and Ca\textsuperscript{2+}. Nitrosylation also significantly reduced subsequent CaMKIIα autophosphorylation specifically at Thr-286, but not at Thr-305. A previously described reduction of CaMKII activity by \emph{S}-nitrosylation at Cys-6 was also observed here, but only after prolonged ({$>$}5 min) exposure to NO donors. These results demonstrate a novel regulation of CaMKII by another second messenger system and indicate its involvement in excitotoxic neuronal cell death.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4–7 Hz) can contribute to memory formation by separating encoding (storage) and retrieval of memories into different functional half-cycles (Hasselmo et al. (2002) Neural Comput 14:793–817). We investigate, via computer simulations, the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal input patterns are achieved by the CA1 microcircuitry. A model of the CA1 microcircuit is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major cell types, including pyramidal (P) cells and four types of inhibitory interneurons: basket (B) cells, axo-axonic (AA) cells, bistratified (BS) cells and oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells. Inputs to the network come from the entorhinal cortex (EC), the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and medial septum. The EC input provides the sensory information, whereas all other inputs provide context and timing information. Septal input provides timing information for phasing storage and recall. Storage is accomplished via a local STDP mediated hetero-association of the EC input pattern and the incoming CA3 input pattern on the CA1 pyramidal cell target synapses. The model simulates the timing of firing of different hippocampal cell types relative to the theta rhythm in anesthetized animals and proposes experimentally confirmed functional roles for the different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the storage and recall cycles (Klausberger et al., (2003, 2004) Nature 421:844–848, Nat Neurosci 7:41–47). Measures of recall performance of new and previously stored input patterns in the presence or absence of various inhibitory interneurons are employed to quantitatively test the performance of our model. Finally, the mean recall quality of the CA1 microcircuit is tested as the number of stored patterns is increased. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Although information is thought to be encoded in the frequency of such oscillations, no frequency decoder has been identified. Rapid superfusion of immobilized Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in vitro showed that the enzyme can decode the frequency of Ca2+ spikes into distinct amounts of kinase activity. The frequency response of CaM kinase II was modulated by several factors, including the amplitude and duration of individual spikes as well as the subunit composition and previous state of activation of the kinase. These features should provide specificity in the activation of this multifunctional enzyme by distinct cellular stimuli and may underlie its pivotal role in activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.}

  abstract = {The emergence of order from chaos is a fundamental question span- ning multiple scientific disciplines, from physics and biology to com- plex social and economic systems. Traditional deterministic perspec- tives often fail to account for the spontaneous organization observed in nature, where seemingly random interactions give rise to struc- tured patterns. This paper explores how stochastic processes, rather than opposing order, act as a crucial mechanism for self-organization.  We propose that stochastic determinism, the interplay between ran- domness and structured evolution, underpins the formation of stable macroscopic laws. Entropy, commonly perceived as a driver of dis- order, is reinterpreted as an organizing force in open systems, where local randomness leads to global order through non-linear interactions and feedback mechanisms.  By integrating mathematical models of stochastic differential equa- tions and the law of large numbers, we demonstrate how fluctuations in quantum mechanics, biological evolution, and socio-economic net- works contribute to emergent complexity. These processes, though driven by chance at a micro level, generate statistically predictable outcomes at a macro-level, bridging the gap between chaos and struc- ture.  The implications of this study extend across disciplines, providing a unifying framework for understanding pattern formation, stability in dynamic systems, and the evolution of complexity. By recogniz- ing stochasticity as an essential principle of natural organization, this research paves the way for advancements in artificial intelligence, cli- mate modeling, and adaptive socio-economic policies. The findings challenge conventional views of randomness, presenting it not as an obstacle but as the fundamental catalyst for the emergence of order.},

We tested in vitro the induction of long-lasting synaptic enhancement at Schaffer collaterals by acetylcholine (ACh) at the apical dendrite of CA1 pyramidal neurons and in vivo by stimulation of cholinergic afferents. In vitro ACh induced a Ca2+ wave and synaptic enhancement mediated by insertion of AMPA receptors in spines. Activation of muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) and Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive stores were required for this synaptic enhancement that was insensitive to blockade of NMDA receptors and also triggered by IP3 uncaging. Activation of cholinergic afferents in vivo induced an analogous atropine-sensitive synaptic enhancement. We describe a novel form of synaptic enhancement (LTPIP3) that is induced in vitro and in vivo by activation of mAChRs. We conclude that Ca2+ released from postsynaptic endoplasmic reticulum stores is the critical event in the induction of this unique form of long-lasting synaptic enhancement.},

We exploit other animals to feed, clothe, and entertain ourselves, to name just a few animal exploitation practices. Such discrimination against other species, or speciesism, is the central focus of the present chapter. Drawing on recent scientific findings, we reveal the psychological connections between speciesism and prejudices such as racism and sexism. Those who support animal exploitation also tend to endorse sexist and racist views and rely on the belief in group dominance and human supremacy to justify systems of inequality and oppression. The common denominator is that the interests of disadvantaged groups like animals, women, and ethnic minorities, are considered subordinate to the interests and privileges of advantaged groups like humans in general, and white men in particular. Although recognizing this intersectionality is critical to the understanding of human-animal relations, explicitly referring to such parallels in animal advocacy campaigns can be easily misunderstood, and may be ineffective or even counterproductive. We see value in experience- and behavior-based interventions where people learn to connect psychologically with animals to change their animal-relevant beliefs, and more generally, to broaden the mind and challenge exploitative societal traditions.},

  abstract = {The discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long-term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP-memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.},

We propose a simple biophysical model for the activation of CaMKII by Ca2+ and calmodulin. The model describes the transition of the subunits of the kinase between their different possible states (inactive, bound to Ca2+–CaM, phosphorylated at Thr286, trapped and autonomous). All transitions are described by classical kinetic equations except for the autophosphorylation step, which is modeled in an empirical manner. The model quantitatively reproduces the experimentally demonstrated frequency sensitivity of CaMKII [Science 279 (1998) 227]. We further use the model to investigate the role of several characterized features of the kinase—as well as some that are not easily attainable by experiments—in its frequency-dependent responses. In cellular microdomains, CaMKII is expected to sense very brief Ca2+ spikes; our simulations under such conditions reveal that the enzyme response is tuned to optimal frequencies. This prediction is then confirmed by experimental data. This novel and simple model should help in understanding the rules that govern CaMKII regulation, as well as those involved in decoding intracellular Ca2+ signals.},

It is from this randomness, however, that a vast array of precisely timed and intricately coordinated biological functions emerge that give rise to the complex forms and behaviors we see in the biosphere around us. This seemingly paradoxical nature of life has drawn the interest of an increasing number of physicists, and recent years have seen stochastic modeling grow into a major subdiscipline within biological physics. Here we review some of the major advances that have shaped our understanding of stochasticity in biology. We begin with some historical context, outlining a string of important experimental results that motivated the development of stochastic modeling. We then embark upon a fairly rigorous treatment of the simulation methods that are currently available for the treatment of stochastic biological models, with an eye toward comparing and contrasting their realms of applicability, and the care that must be taken when parameterizing them. Following that, we describe how stochasticity impacts several key biological functions, including transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis, chromosome replication, and metabolism, before considering how the functions may be coupled into a comprehensive model of a ‘minimal cell’. Finally, we close with our expectation for the future of the field, focusing on how mesoscopic stochastic methods may be augmented with atomic-scale molecular modeling approaches in order to understand life across a range of length and time scales.},

Time related statistical models for the period of 1996 to 2010 are estimated to assess the impact of research funding and other determinant factors on the quantity and quality of the scientific output of individual funded researchers in Canadian natural sciences and engineering. Results confirm a positive impact of funding on the quantity and quality of the publications. In addition, the existence of the Matthew effect is partially confirmed such that the rich get richer. Although a positive relation between the career age and the rate of publications is observed, it is found that the career age negatively affects the quality of works. Moreover, the results suggest that young researchers who work in large teams are more likely to produce high quality publications. We also found that even though academic researchers produce higher quantity of papers it is the researchers with industrial affiliation whose work is of higher quality. Finally, we observed that strategic, targeted and high priority funding programs lead to higher quantity and quality of publications.},

  abstract = {Initially prepared as part of the Foundations of the Unity of Science volumes under the auspices of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, Science and the Structure of Ethics soon took on a life of its own. Well positioned in the naturalistic tradition of ethical theory extending from John Dewey at the start and Richard Rorty at the conclusion of the century, Abraham Edel's volume offers a remarkable synthesis of the ways hi which ethical statements can be examined, and the nature of ethical concerns.Edel reveals a singular capacity to move beyond oracular controversies of the good and the right hi favor of a comparative, analytic, and functional account of how ethical perspectives and practices affect the content of moral discourse. In Edel's work, the structure of ethical behavior is defined by biological, psychological, social, and historical functions. Hence a scientific account of ethics is possible since moral norms are themselves products of an experiential field open to verification procedures common to all other walks of human life.In reviewing the impact of Edel's work hi general, and this volume in particular, Irving Louis Horowitz notes that Edel's naturalistic emphasis fits neatly with a view of ethics as something grounded in human experience rather than mandated from divine assumption: "It is hard for me to imagine a turning back from the hard lessons of the century, any more in ethical theory than in empirical research as such. We owe a central place in our century's intellectual capital to Edel's examination of ethical doctrines in the light of changing circumstances." This is a work certain to enlist the interest of ethicists, sociologists of knowledge, as well as those concerned with issues hi the philosophy of science and religion alike.},

This trend is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where limited access to paid content has fueled the growth of open-access publications. Additionally, the prevailing “publish or perish” culture has encouraged the pursuit of inconsequential and conformist research. The scholarly integrity of academic institutions is eroded when they struggle with evaluating research impact through metrics, potentially overlooking substantive contribution. The emergence of AI technology adds a fresh dimension to the issue, creating new possibilities for mass output rather than work that is innovative or informed by social values and priorities. This commentary serves as a call to action for scholars, institutions, and policymakers collectively to reshape the trajectory of academic publishing, restoring its sense of purpose through making lasting contributions to the betterment of society.},

The concentration of the kinase, measured by radioimmunoassay, varies markedly in different brain regions. It is most highly concentrated in the telencephalon where it comprises approximately 2\% of the total hippocampal protein, 1.3\% of cortical protein, and 0.7\% of striatal protein. It is less concentrated in lower brain structures, ranging from about 0.3\% of hypothalamic protein to 0.1\% of protein in the pons/medulla. The gradient of staining intensity observed in brain sections by immunohistochemistry corroborates this distribution. Neurons and neuropil of the hippocampus are densely stained, whereas little staining is observed in lower brain regions such as the superior colliculus. Within the diencephalon and midbrain, dense staining is observed only in thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra. The skewed distribution of alpha-subunit appears to be due in part to the occurrence in the cerebellum and pons/medulla of forms of the kinase with a high ratio of beta- to alpha-subunits. However, most of the variation is due to the extremely high concentration of the kinase in particular neurons, especially those of the hippocampus, cortex and striatum. The unusually high expression of the kinase in these neurons is likely to confer upon them specialized responses to calcium ion that are different from those of neurons in lower brain regions.},

If significant results are consistently favored in the review process, published results could systematically overstate the magnitude of their findings even under ideal conditions. In this paper, we measure the impact of this publication bias on political science using a new data set of published quantitative results. Although any measurement of publication bias depends on the prior distribution of empirical relationships, we determine that published estimates in political science are on average substantially larger than their true value under a variety of reasonable choices for this prior. We also find that many published estimates have a false positive probability substantially greater than the conventional α = 0.05 threshold for statistical significance if the prior probability of a null relationship exceeds 50\%. Finally, although the proportion of published false positives would be reduced if significance tests used a smaller α, this change would not solve the problem of upward bias in the magnitude of published results.},

Progress in this area requires a clear view of the methodology applied, the data sets used for training and testing the systems, and the evaluation procedures. We have analysed the impact of a representative set of features and algorithms and highlighted the problems inherent in generating reliable protein data sets and in the posterior analysis of the results. Although it is clear that there have been some improvements in methods for predicting interacting sites, several major bottlenecks remain. Proteins in complexes are still under-represented in the structural databases and in particular many proteins involved in transient complexes are still to be crystallized. We provide suggestions for effective feature selection, and make it clear that community standards for testing, training and performance measures are necessary for progress in the field.},

The approach is notable in that it allows one to systematically incorporate site-specific details about protein-protein interactions into a model for the dynamics of a signal-transduction system, but the method has other applications as well, such as following the fates of individual carbon atoms in metabolic reactions. The consequences of protein-protein interactions are difficult to specify and track with a conventional modeling approach because of the large number of protein phosphoforms and protein complexes that these interactions potentially generate. Here, we focus on how a rule-based model is specified in the BioNetGen language (BNGL) and how a model specification is analyzed using the BioNetGen software tool. We also discuss new developments in rule-based modeling that should enable the construction and analyses of comprehensive models for signal transduction pathways and similarly large-scale models for other biochemical systems.},

  abstract = {The examination of the physiological role of CaMKII has made substantial progress in non-epithelial systems but little is known about its function in secretory epithelial cells. A prototypic exocrine cell, the acid secreting gastric parietal cell, largely redistributes its cytoplasmic tubulocisternal membranes (TC) to the secretory apical membrane (SA) after stimulation. We here present a dependence of physiological response on partitioned initial CaMKII activities redistributed between TC and SA. Initial acid secretion after cholinergic stimulation has doubled if activities of phosphatases PP1/PP2A and protein kinase PKC-alpha were inhibited by the inhibitors calyculin A and Gö 6976. CaMKII appears to be integrated in multienzyme complexes each specific for TC and SA. Therein, PP1/PP2A and PKC-alpha were found to permanently counteract initial CaMKII activities in different modes of transregulation. Remarkably, a dys-transregulated, hyperactive CaMKII at TC did not result in an increased acid secretion to the same extent. A simple mathematical model to estimate the share of TC- and SA-associated CaMKII activities in cholinergically induced acid secretion suggests that TC-associated CaMKII appears to autoregulate its contribution to the physiological response by a negative feedback control. Subcellular distribution and stimulus-dependent redistribution of domain-associated CaMKII signalosomes indicate a fine balanced, adaptive system to guarantee a stable physiological response.},

Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report “negative” results (results that fail to support the tested hypothesis). Therefore, if publication pressures increase scientific bias, the frequency of “positive” results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and “productive” academic environments. This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US. Across all disciplines, papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that, according to NSF data, produced more academic papers per capita. The size of this effect increased when controlling for state's per capita R\&D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results, including discipline and methodology. Although the confounding effect of institutions' prestige could not be excluded (researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments), these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists' productivity but also their bias. The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high.},

Myelination by oligodendrocytes increases conduction velocity, affecting spike timing and oscillations in neuronal activity.

In developing hippocampus, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB4–7 increases in parallel with the ability to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP)8–10. Here we report a mechanism by which BDNF modulates hippocampal LTP. Exogenous BDNF promoted the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation in young (postnatal day 12–13) hippocampal slices, which in the absence of BDNF show only short-term potentiation (STP). This effect was due to an enhanced ability of hippocampal synapses to respond to tetanic stimulation, rather than to a direct modulation of the LTP-triggering mechanism. A TrkB–IgG fusion protein, which scavenges endogenous BDNF11, reduced the synaptic responses to tetanus as well as the magnitude of LTP in adult hippocampus. Our results suggest that BDNF may regulate LTP in developing and adult hippocampus by enhancing synaptic responses to tetanic stimulation.},

Only CaMKIIbeta, which peaks in expression early in development, but not CaMKIIalpha, has this morphogenic activity. A small insert in CaMKIIbeta, which is absent in CaMKIIalpha, confers regulated F-actin localization to the enzyme and enables selective upregulation of dendritic motility.

  abstract = {The level of intracellular Ca2+ plays a central role in normal and pathological signaling within and between neurons. These processes involve a cascade of events for locally raising and lowering cytosolic Ca2+. As the mechanisms for age-related alteration in Ca2+ dysregulation have been illuminated, hypotheses concerning Ca2+ homeostasis and brain aging have been modified. The idea that senescence is due to pervasive cell loss associated with elevated resting Ca2+ has been replaced by concepts concerning changes in local Ca2+ levels associated with neural activity. This article reviews evidence for a shift in the sources of intracellular Ca2+ characterized by a diminished role for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and an increased role for intracellular stores and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Physiological and biological models are outlined, which relate a shift in Ca2+ regulation with changes in cell excitability and synaptic plasticity, resulting in a functional lesion of the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are critical mediators of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, but the differential roles of NR2A- versus NR2B-containing NMDARs have been controversial. Here, we investigate the roles of NR2A and NR2B in long-term potentiation (LTP) in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures using RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression, to complement pharmacological approaches. In young slices, when NR2B is the predominant subunit expressed, LTP is blocked by the NR2B-selective antagonist Ro25-6981 [R-(R,S)-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine propranol]. As slices mature and NR2A expression rises, activation of NR2B receptors became no longer necessary for LTP induction. LTP was blocked, however, by RNAi knockdown of NR2B, and this was rescued by coexpression of an RNAi-resistant NR2B (NR2B*) cDNA. Interestingly, a chimeric NR2B subunit in which the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail was replaced by that of NR2A failed to rescue LTP, whereas the reverse chimera, NR2A channel with NR2B tail, was able to restore LTP. Thus, expression of NR2B with its intact cytoplasmic tail is required for LTP induction, at an age when channel activity of NR2B–NMDARs is not required for LTP. Overexpression of wild-type NR2A failed to rescue LTP in neurons transfected with the NR2B–RNAi construct, despite restoring NMDA–EPSC amplitude to a similar level as NR2B*. Surprisingly, an NR2A construct lacking its entire C-terminal cytoplasmic tail regained its ability to restore LTP. Together, these data suggest that the NR2B subunit plays a critical role for LTP, presumably by recruiting relevant molecules important for LTP via its cytoplasmic tail. In contrast, NR2A is not essential for LTP, and its cytoplasmic tail seems to carry inhibitory factors for LTP.},

  abstract = {A number of hormones secreted from the pituitary—adrenal system during stress affect learning and memory processes. The phenomenon of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is viewed by many as a putative mechanism of memory storage and has proved a most valuable model for study of neuronal plasticity at the cellular level. The present study was conducted to investigate the possibility that stressful events which occur prior (in vivo) to the preparation of brain slices may influence the electrophysiology of the in vitro hippocampal explant when tested for LTP. Adult male rats (Long-Evans male × Sprague-Dawley female) were pair-housed 1 week prior to testing. One animal in each pair was either placed in a restraining tube for 30 min and received no tail shocks (Restraint) or placed in a restraining tube and received tail shocks (1 μA, 1 s) every minute for 30 min (Restraint + Shock). The other animal in each pair was taken directly from the home cage and received no restraint or tail shock (Control). In vitro hippocampal slices were then prepared immediately from these animals according to standard methods. Our results demonstrate a marked impairment of LTP in hippocampal explants taken from rats exposed to stress. The significance of this result with respect to cellular mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress, cognition, and learning is discussed.},

  abstract = {Repeated stimulation of hippocampal neurons can induce an immediate and prolonged increase in synaptic strength that is called long-term potentiation (LTP)—the primary cellular model of memory in the mammalian brain1. An early phase of LTP (lasting less than three hours) can be dissociated from late-phase LTP by using inhibitors of transcription and translation2–8. Because protein synthesis occurs mainly in the cell body9–12, whereas LTP is input-specific, the question arises of how the synapse specificity of late LTP is achieved without elaborate intracellular protein trafficking. We propose that LTP initiates the creation of a short-lasting protein-synthesis-independent 'synaptic tag' at the potentiated synapse which sequesters the relevant protein(s) to establish late LTP. In support of this idea, we now show that weak tetanic stimulation, which ordinarily leads only to early LTP, or repeated tetanization in the presence of protein-synthesis inhibitors, each results in protein-synthesis-dependent late LTP, provided repeated tetanization has already been applied at another input to the same population of neurons. The synaptic tag decays in less than three hours. These findings indicate that the persistence of LTP depends not only on local events during its induction, but also on the prior activity of the neuron.},

  abstract = {Science depends on trustworthy evidence. Thus, a biased scientific record is of questionable value because it impedes scientific progress, and the public receives advice on the basis of unreliable evidence that has the potential to have far-reaching detrimental consequences. Meta-analysis is a technique that can be used to summarize research evidence. However, meta-analytic effect size estimates may themselves be biased, threatening the validity and usefulness of meta-analyses to promote scientific progress. Here, we offer a large-scale simulation study to elucidate how p-hacking and publication bias distort meta-analytic effect size estimates under a broad array of circumstances that reflect the reality that exists across a variety of research areas. The results revealed that, first, very high levels of publication bias can severely distort the cumulative evidence. Second, p-hacking and publication bias interact: At relatively high and low levels of publication bias, p-hacking does comparatively little harm, but at medium levels of publication bias, p-hacking can considerably contribute to bias, especially when the true effects are very small or are approaching zero. Third, p-hacking can severely increase the rate of false positives. A key implication is that, in addition to preventing p-hacking, policies in research institutions, funding agencies, and scientific journals need to make the prevention of publication bias a top priority to ensure a trustworthy base of evidence.

We studied in vitro in CA1 pyramidal neurons the contribution of AMPA and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) components of Schaffer collateral (SC) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs; EPSPAMPA and EPSPNMDA) and of the back-propagating action potential (BAP) to the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a STDP protocol that consisted in pairing an EPSP and a BAP. Transient blockade of EPSPAMPA with 7-nitro-2,3-dioxo-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-6-carbonitrile (CNQX) during the STDP protocol prevented LTP. Contrastingly LTP was induced under transient inhibition of EPSPAMPA by combining SC stimulation, an imposed EPSPAMPA-like depolarization, and BAP or by coupling the EPSPNMDA evoked under sustained depolarization (approximately −40 mV) and BAP. In Mg2+-free solution EPSPNMDA and BAP also produced LTP. Suppression of EPSPNMDA or BAP always prevented LTP. Thus activation of NMDA receptors and BAPs are needed but not sufficient because AMPA receptor activation is also obligatory for STDP. However, a transient depolarization of another origin that unblocks NMDA receptors and a BAP may also trigger LTP.},

In contrast, long-term depression (LTD) was induced by application of 10 μM ACPD in the absence of test inputs. When 10 μM ACPD was applied in the presence of test inputs, co-application of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, d,l-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate resulted in LTD induction when used at 50 μM. In ACPD-induced LTP, the delivery of test synaptic inputs to CA1 neurons could be replaced by co-application of NMDA (100 nM) during ACPD perfusion. These results suggest that, in CA1 neurons, a co-operative effect involving the activation of both mGluRs and NMDA receptors is required to trigger the process involved in ACPD-induced LTP. In addition, ACPD-induced LTD was blocked by co-application of an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor inhibitor, 2-aminotheoxydiphenyl borate (10 μM), which had no effect on ACPD-induced LTP. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate that ACPD-induced LTP involves NMDA receptors, but not IP3 receptors, whereas the converse applies to ACPD-induced LTD.},

  abstract = {The observation that autophosphorylation converts CaM kinase II from the Ca2+-dependent form to the Ca2+-independent form has led to speculation that the formation of the Ca2+-independent form of the enzyme could encode frequency of synaptic usage and serve as a molecular explanation of “memory”. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, glutamate elevated the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II through autophosphorylation, and this response was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist, d-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). In addition, we confirmed that high, but not low frequency stimulation, applied to two groups of CA1 afferents in the rat hippocampus, resulted in LTP induction with concomitant long-lasting increases in Ca2+-independent and total activities of CaM kinase II. In experiments with 32P-labeled hippocampal slices, the LTP induction in the CA1 region was associated with increases in autophosphorylation of both α and β subunits of CaM kinase II 1 h after LTP induction. Significant increases in phosphorylation of endogenous CaM kinase II substrates, synapsin I and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which are originally located in presynaptic and postsynaptic regions, respectively, were also observed in the same slice. All these changes were prevented when high frequency stimulation was applied in the presence of AP5 or a calmodulin antagonist, calmidazolium. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor by CaM kinase II was reported in the postsynaptic density and infusion of the constitutively active CaM kinase II into the hippocampal neurons enhanced kainate-induced response. These results support the idea that CaM kinase II contributes to the induction of hippocampal LTP in both postsynaptic and presynaptic regions through phosphorylation of target proteins such as the AMPA receptor, MAP2 and synapsin I.

Using a Morris water maze task, the LTP-blocking GluN2A antagonist had no significant effect on any aspect of performance, whereas the LTD-blocking GluN2B antagonist impaired spatial memory consolidation. Moreover, similar spatial memory deficits were induced by inhibiting the expression of LTD with intrahippocampal infusion of a short peptide that specifically interferes with AMPA receptor endocytosis.

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

  abstract = {Binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2B controls long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory. Regulation of this interaction is well-studied biochemically, but not under conditions that mimic the macromolecular crowding found within cells. Notably, previous molecular crowding experiments with lysozyme indicated an effect on the CaMKII holoenzyme conformation. Here, we found that the effect of molecular crowding on Ca2+/CaM-induced CaMKII binding to immobilized GluN2B in vitro depended on the specific crowding reagent. While binding was reduced by lysozyme, it was enhanced by BSA. The ATP content in the BSA preparation caused CaMKII autophosphorylation at T286 during the binding reaction; however, enhanced binding was also observed when autophosphorylation was blocked. Importantly, the positive regulation by nucleotide and BSA (as well as other macromolecular crowding reagents) did not alleviate the requirement for CaMKII stimulation to induce GluN2B binding. The differential effect of lysozyme (14 kDa) and BSA (66 kDa) was not due to size difference, as both dextran-10 and dextran-70 enhanced binding. By contrast, crowding with immunoglobulin G (IgG) reduced binding. Notably, lysozyme and IgG but not BSA directly bound to Ca2+/CaM in an overlay assay, suggesting a competition of lysozyme and IgG with the Ca2+/CaM-stimulus that induces CaMKII/GluN2B binding. However, lysozyme negatively regulated binding even when it was instead induced by CaMKII T286 phosphorylation. Alternative modes of competition would be with CaMKII or GluN2B, and the negative effects of lysozyme and IgG indeed also correlated with specific or non-specific binding to the immobilized GluN2B. Thus, the effect of any specific crowding reagent can differ, depending on its additional direct effects on CaMKII/GluN2B binding. However, the results of this study also indicate that, in principle, macromolecular crowding enhances CaMKII binding to GluN2B.},

A widely accepted model posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.},

This is the first study to explore how this is achieved in relation to their participation in implementing refinement and reduction, two of the three key guiding ethical principles--the "3Rs"--of what is deemed to be humane animal experimentation. The interpretative approach contributes to emerging work within the social sciences and humanities exploring care and ethics in practice. Based on qualitative analysis of participant observation within animal research facilities in UK universities, in-depth interviews with ATs, facility managers, and other stakeholders, and analysis of regulatory guidelines, we draw a contrast between the minimum required of ATs by law and how their care work not only meets but often exceeds these requirements. We outline how ATs constitute a key source of innovation and insight into the refinement of animal care and the reduction of animal use, hitherto not formally acknowledged. Exploring AT care work as an example of ethics in practice makes an original contribution to broader debates within health care and animal welfare about how technology, regulation, and behavior can foster and sustain a "culture of care".},

  abstract = {Whole cell/patch-clamp and extracellular field potential recordings were used to study the induction and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor independent long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of the in vitro rat hippocampus. Induction of NMDA receptor independent LTP was prevented by manipulations that inhibited postsynaptic depolarization during tetanic stimulation: direct hyperpolarization of postsynaptic neurons and bath application of an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor antagonist. NMDA receptor independent LTP also was blocked by intracellular application of the lidocaine derivative, N-(2,6-dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl)triethylammonium bromide (QX-314), to CA1 pyramidal neurons. These results complement the previous findings that NMDA receptor independent LTP was inhibited by postsynaptic injections of the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and also was inhibited by a L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist (nifedipine). Collectively, these data make a strong case for the postsynaptic induction of this form of LTP. This paper also provides evidence for postsynaptic expression of NMDA receptor independent LTP. In an experiment where AMPA- and NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were isolated pharmacologically, LTP was found for only the AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSPs. In a separate experiment, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was measured during NMDA receptor independent LTP. Although there was an initial decrease in PPF, suggesting a posttetanic increase in the probability of glutamate release, the change in PPF decayed within 30-40 min of the tetanic stimulation, whereas the magnitude of the LTP was constant over this same time period. In addition, the LTP, but not the corresponding change in PPF, was blocked by the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (+/-)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. These results are accounted for most easily by a selective increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptor function, but one type of presynaptic modification-an increase in the number of release sites without an overall change in the probability of release-also could account for these results (assuming that the level of glutamate release before LTP induction fully saturated NMDA, but not AMPA, receptors). One possible presynaptic modification, an increase in axon excitability, was ruled out by analysis of the presynaptic fiber volley, which was not increased at any time after LTP induction.},

It begins with an overview of different methods available for biochemical simulations highlighting their strengths and limitations. Spatial stochastic modeling approaches are indicated when diffusion is relatively slow and spatial inhomogeneities involve relatively small numbers of particles. The popular software package MCell allows particle-based stochastic simulations of biochemical systems in complex three dimensional (3D) geometries, which are important for many cell biology applications. Here, we provide an overview of the simulation algorithms used by MCell and the underlying theory. We then give a tutorial on building and simulating MCell models using the CellBlender graphical user interface, that is built as a plug-in to Blender, a widely-used and freely available software platform for 3D modeling. The tutorial starts with simple models that demonstrate basic MCell functionality and then advances to a number of more complex examples that demonstrate a range of features and provide examples of important biophysical effects that require spatially-resolved stochastic dynamics to capture.},

T286A-KI mice displayed cognitive deficits in a novel object recognition test and an anxiolytic phenotype in the elevated plus maze, suggesting disruption of normal developmental processes. At the molecular level, the ratio of total CaMKIIα to CaMKIIβ in hippocampal lysates was significantly decreased≈2-fold in T286A-KI mice, and levels of both isoforms in synaptic subcellular fractions were decreased by≈80\%. Total levels of GluA1 AMPA-glutamate receptor subunits and phosphorylation of GluA1 at the CaMKII site (Ser831) in synaptic fractions were unaltered, as were the frequency and amplitude of AMPAR-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents at hippocampal CA3–CA1 synapses. Synaptic levels of NMDA-glutamate receptor GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunits also were unaltered. However, the reduced ratio of CaMKII to NMDAR subunits in synaptic fractions was linked to increased synaptic NMDAR-mediated currents in T286A-KI mice, apparently due to increased functional contributions by GluN2B NMDARs (assessed by Ro 25-6981 sensitivity). Thus, disruption of CaMKII synaptic targeting caused by elimination of Thr286 autophosphorylation leads to synaptic and behavioral deficits during pre-adolescence.},

Changes in spine shape and wholesale spine turnover provide mechanisms for modifying existing synaptic connections and altering neuronal connectivity. Although neuronal cell death in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases is clearly an important factor in decline of cognitive or motor function, loss of dendritic spines, in the absence of cell death, may also contribute to impaired brain function in these diseases, as well as in psychiatric disorders and aging. Because spines can function in neuroprotection in vitro, advances toward a molecular understanding of spine maintenance might one day aid in the design of therapies to minimize neurological damage following excitotoxic injury. In addition, progress in defining the biochemical basis of spine development and stabilization may yield insights into mental retardation and psychiatric disorders.},

These narratives contain answers to the direct question “why do you publish?” as well as remarks on motivations to publish in relation to other questions and themes. The interdisciplinary interpretation is based on both sociological science studies and philosophy of science in practice.,At each career stage, epistemic, pragmatic, and personal motivations to publish are weighed differently. Confirming earlier studies, the authors find that PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in temporary positions mainly feel pressured to publish for career-related reasons. However, across status groups, researchers also want to publish in order to support collective knowledge generation.,The sample of interviewees may be biased toward those interested in reflecting on their day-to-day work.,Continuous and collective reflection is imperative for preventing uncritical internalization of pragmatic reasons to publish. Creating occasions for reflection is a task not only of researchers themselves, but also of administrators, funders, and other stakeholders.,Most studies have illuminated how researchers publish while adapting to or growing into the contemporary publish-or-perish culture. This paper addresses the rarely asked question why researchers publish at all.},

NMDA receptors are also implicated in the pathophysiology of several CNS disorders and more recently have been identified as a locus for disease-associated genomic variation. NMDA receptors exist as a diverse array of subtypes formed by variation in assembly of seven subunits (GluN1, GluN2A-D, and GluN3A-B) into tetrameric receptor complexes. These NMDA receptor subtypes show unique structural features that account for their distinct functional and pharmacological properties allowing precise tuning of their physiological roles. Here, we review the relationship between NMDA receptor structure and function with an emphasis on emerging atomic resolution structures, which begin to explain unique features of this receptor.},

  abstract = {Initial autophosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) occurs at Thr286 (the "autonomy" site) and converts the kinase from a Ca(2+)-dependent to a partially Ca(2+)-independent or autonomous enzyme. After removal of Ca2+/calmodulin, the autonomous kinase undergoes a "burst" of inhibitory autophosphorylation at sites distinct from the autonomy site which may be masked in the presence of bound calmodulin. This burst of Ca(2+)-independent autophosphorylation blocks the ability of calmodulin to activate the kinase. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace putative inhibitory autophosphorylation sites within the calmodulin binding domain of recombinant alpha-CaM kinase with nonphosphorylatable alanines and examined the effects on autophosphorylation, kinase activity, and calmodulin binding. Although prominent Ca(2+)-independent autophosphorylation occurs within the calmodulin binding domain at Thr305, Thr306, and Ser314 in wild-type alpha-CaM kinase, the inhibitory effect on kinase activity and calmodulin binding is retained in mutants lacking any one of these three sites. However, when both Thr305 and Thr306 are converted to alanines the kinase does not display inhibition of either activity or calmodulin binding. Autophosphorylation at either Thr305 or Thr306 is therefore sufficient to block both binding and activation of the kinase by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thr306 is also slowly autophosphorylated in a basal reaction in the continuous absence of Ca2+/calmodulin. Autophosphorylation of Thr306 by the kinase in either its basal or autonomous state suggests that in the absence of bound calmodulin, the region of the autoregulatory domain surrounding Thr306, rather than the region near the autonomy site, lies nearest the peptide substrate binding site of the kinase.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a specific form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that is a leading mechanism of learning and memory in mammals. The properties of cooperativity, input specificity, and associativity are essential for LTP; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, based on experimentally observed phenomena, we introduce a computational model of synaptic plasticity in a pyramidal cell to explore the mechanisms responsible for the cooperativity, input specificity, and associativity of LTP. The model is based on molecular processes involved in synaptic plasticity and integrates gene expression involved in the regulation of neuronal activity. In the model, we introduce a local positive feedback loop of protein synthesis at each synapse, which is essential for bimodal response and synapse specificity. Bifurcation analysis of the local positive feedback loop of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling illustrates the existence of bistability, which is the basis of LTP induction. The local bifurcation diagram provides guidance for the realization of LTP, and the projection of whole system trajectories onto the two-parameter bifurcation diagram confirms the predictions obtained from bifurcation analysis. Moreover, model analysis shows that pre- and postsynaptic components are required to achieve the three properties of LTP. This study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the cooperativity, input specificity, and associativity of LTP, and the further construction of neural networks for learning and memory.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (l.t.p.) was studied in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices during development at post-natal days 1-8, 15 and 60. Tetanic stimulation at 100 Hz for 1 s was delivered to the fibres in stratum radiatum and the time course of potentiation was recorded in stratum pyramidale for 20 min after tetanus. L.t.p. was measured at 20 min post-tetanus as an increase in the amplitude of the population spike. The time course and magnitude of post-tetanic potentiation (p.t.p.) differed with age. For 60-day-old animals p.t.p. was seen as a maximally potentiated response immediately post-tetanus that declined to a smaller potentiated response by 5 min post-tetanus. For animals younger than 15 days the response was also maximally potentiated immediately post-tetanus with subsequent decline. However, the duration of maximal potentiation was shorter and the magnitude was less. A different time course of p.t.p. was observed at 15 days. The maximal potentiation was approximately equal to that seen at 60 days, but instead of declining, the response remained maximally potentiated throughout the entire post-tetanus monitoring period. L.t.p. was first observed at post-natal day 5, and by post-natal days 7 and 8 substantial levels of l.t.p. were seen consistently. The greatest magnitude of l.t.p. was found at 15 days, and was considerably more than that produced at 60 days. When the duration of l.t.p. was monitored for longer than 20 min the response declined back to pretetanus levels by 1-1 1/2 h for animals younger than 15 days. In 15-day-old rats the response remained maximally potentiated for the full 72 min that it was monitored, with no decline. In control experiments of low-frequency stimulation (l.f.s.) at 1/15 s for 100 stimuli, hippocampal slices from 60-day-old animals showed response elevation. In contrast, l.f.s. resulted in response decrement over time for slices from 5-15-day-old animals. Three measures of pretetanus excitability in area CA1 suggested an increase with age. The stimulus intensity required for field excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) threshold declined, the magnitude of the maximal population spike amplitude increased, and the population spike latency decreased. These results suggest that the magnitude of l.t.p. is not strictly related to the pretetanus excitability of CA1 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

BioNetGen is an open-source platform that provides a simple yet expressive language for rule-based modeling (BNGL). In this paper we describe compartmental BNGL (cBNGL), which extends BNGL to enable explicit modeling of the compartmental organization of the cell and its effects on system dynamics. We show that by making localization a queryable attribute of both molecules and species and introducing appropriate volumetric scaling of reaction rates, the effects of compartmentalization can be naturally modeled using rules. These properties enable the construction of new rule semantics that include both universal rules, those defining interactions that can take place in any compartment in the system, and transport rules, which enable movement of molecular complexes between compartments.},

  abstract = {Due to its probabilistic nature, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is subject to decision errors. The concern for false positives has overshadowed the concern for false negatives in the recent debates in psychology. This might be unwarranted, since reported statistically nonsignificant findings may just be ‘too good to be false’. We examined evidence for false negatives in nonsignificant results in three different ways. We adapted the Fisher test to detect the presence of at least one false negative in a set of statistically nonsignificant results. Simulations show that the adapted Fisher method generally is a powerful method to detect false negatives. We examined evidence for false negatives in the psychology literature in three applications of the adapted Fisher method. These applications indicate that (i) the observed effect size distribution of nonsignificant effects exceeds the expected distribution assuming a null-effect, and approximately two out of three (66.7\%) psychology articles reporting nonsignificant results contain evidence for at least one false negative, (ii) nonsignificant results on gender effects contain evidence of true nonzero effects, and (iii) the statistically nonsignificant replications from the Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) do not warrant strong conclusions about the absence or presence of true zero effects underlying these nonsignificant results. We conclude that false negatives deserve more attention in the current debate on statistical practices in psychology. Potentially neglecting effects due to a lack of statistical power can lead to a waste of research resources and stifle the scientific discovery process.},

Often dealing with that at later development stages is costly. Emergent behaviors are the main concern, particularly in the development of complex systems. However, identifying and predicting them is challenging in complex systems as it involves lots of components and interactions. Prior to making wise design decisions, developers need to elucidate and understand the emergent behaviors. For this reason, a conceptual model that highlights the presence of emergent behavior at an early stage is essential in the systems development. The conceptual model is useful in achieving higher coverage as it is correlated with the probability of identifying more emergent behaviors. Therefore, this paper goes through the existing work focusing on effort in modeling emergent behavior and presents perspectives on developing a conceptual model that is able to inform the presence of emergent behavior.},

Computational science is the application of computer science and software engineering principles to solving scientific problems, whereas computer science is the study of computer hardware and software design. The Open Science agenda holds that science advances faster when we can build on existing results. Therefore, research software has to be reusable for advancing science. Thus, we need proper research software engineering for obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However, research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit from reuse when research software is involved. For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open and adhere to the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and repeatable) to allow repeatability, reproducibility, and reuse. Compared to research data, research software should be both archived for reproducibility and actively maintained for reusability. The FAIR data principles do not require openness, but research software should be open source software. Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options, such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed. We review and analyze the current state in this area in order to give recommendations for making computer science research software FAIR and open. We observe that research software publishing practices in computer science and in computational science show significant differences.},

Long-term potentiation (LTP) or increased activity of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) induced delivery of tagged AMPA-Rs into synapses. This effect was not diminished by mutating the CaMKII phosphorylation site on the GluR1 AMPA-R subunit, but was blocked by mutating a predicted PDZ domain interaction site. These results show that LTP and CaMKII activity drive AMPA-Rs to synapses by a mechanism that requires the association between GluR1 and a PDZ domain protein.},

The answer to the initial question, the self-experiment and the associated demand for openness, posed several challenges for a doctoral student, the institution, and the examination regulations, which are still based on the publication of an individually written and completed work that cannot be viewed by the public during the creation process. In the case of data and other documents, publication is usually not planned even after completion. This state of affairs in the use of open science in the humanities will be compared with open science best practices in the physical sciences. The reasons and influencing factors for open developments in science and research are presented, empirically and experimentally tested in the development of the first completely open humanities-based PhD thesis. The results of this two-part study show that it is possible to publish everything related to the doctoral study, qualification, and research process as soon as possible, as comprehensively as possible, and under an open license.},

Synapse loss has a devastating effect on cellular communication, leading to wide ranging effects such as network disruption within central neural systems and muscle wastage in the periphery. These devastating effects link synaptic pathology to a diverse range of neurological disorders, spanning Alzheimer’s disease to multiple sclerosis.

  abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) interprets information conveyed by the amplitude and frequency of calcium transients by a controlled transition from an autoinhibited basal intermediate to an autonomously active phosphorylated intermediate (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998). We used spin labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to elucidate the structural and dynamic bases of autoinhibition and activation of the kinase domain of CaMKII. In contrast to existing models, we find that autoinhibition involves a conformeric equilibrium of the regulatory domain, modulating substrate and nucleotide access. Binding of calmodulin to the regulatory domain induces conformational changes that release the catalytic cleft, activating the kinase and exposing an otherwise inaccessible phosphorylation site, threonine 286. Autophosphorylation at Thr286 further disrupts the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory domains, enhancing the interaction with calmodulin, but maintains the regulatory domain in a dynamic unstructured conformation following dissociation of calmodulin, sustaining activation. These findings support a mechanistic model of the CaMKII holoenzyme grounded in a dynamic understanding of autoregulation that is consistent with a wealth of biochemical and functional data.},

  abstract = {Activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) by calmodulin following calcium entry into the cell is important for long-term potentiation (LTP). Here a model of calmodulin binding and trapping by CaMKII in a dendritic spine was used to estimate levels and durations of CaMKII activation following LTP-inducing tetani. The calcium signal was calcium influx through NMDA receptor channels computed in a highly detailed dentate granule cell model. Calcium could bind to calmodulin and calmodulin to CaMKII. CaMKII subunits were either free, bound with calmodulin, trapped, autonomous, or capped. Strong low-frequency tetanic input produced little calmodulin trapping or CaMKII activation. Strong high-frequency tetanic input caused large numbers of CaMKII subunits to become trapped, and CaMKII was strongly activated. Calmodulin trapping and CaMKII activation were highly dependent on tetanus frequency (particularly between 10 and 100 Hz) and were highly sensitive to relatively small changes in the calcium signal. Repetition of a short high-frequency tetanus was necessary to achieve high levels of CaMKII activation. Three stages of CaMKII activation were found in the model: a short, highly activated stage; an intermediate, moderately active stage; and a long-lasting third stage, whose duration depended on dephosphorylation rates but whose decay rate was faster at low CaMKII activation levels than at high levels. It is not clear which of these three stages is most important for LTP.},

  abstract = {Gender and racial disparities have greatly diminished in academia over the last 30~years, but attrition rates among women and minority faculty still remain high. In this paper we examine gender and racial disparities in publishing, an activity that is important for career advancement, but has not been incorporated adequately into the debate on faculty attrition. We surveyed a random sample of 1,065 authors who contributed a peer-reviewed journal article indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) in 2005 and at least one other article during the period of 2001–2004 in four academic disciplines representing natural sciences (biochemistry and water resources) and social sciences (anthropology and economics). We then report on the relationships between demographic variables (gender and race/ethnicity) and career-related variables (academic rank, discipline, and h-index) of these authors. Our findings show that at every career level and within each discipline, women were under-represented in academic positions compared to men and an even lower percentage of women published at each academic level than were employed at that level. Further, we found that women had lower h-indices than men in all four disciplines surveyed. Societal and biological constraints may reduce women’s ability to obtain research intensive positions and contribute to these gender disparities. Hispanics and blacks were underrepresented among individuals awarded with doctoral degrees, doctorate recipients employed in academia, and academics publishing in WoS as compared to their representation in the population. Whites, Asians, and Native Americans and Pacific Islanders were adequately or over-represented in each category. Additionally, blacks had lower h-indices than the other ethnic groups across the disciplines surveyed. Compared to women, attrition among blacks and Hispanics appears to occur earlier in their career development. Cumulative experiences with discrimination and stereotypes may partly explain higher attrition and lower publication productivity among blacks and Hispanics.},

To test this theory, rats learned trial-unique sequences of spatial locations along a runway box and were tested on recall by removing one of the locations in the sequence and making the rat choose the correct location to be rewarded. Once animals were able to reliably perform this episodic memory task, they received lesions to either CA3 or CA1. Animals with lesions to either CA3 or CA1 had difficulty with episodic memory processing, although CA1 lesioned animals had a much greater deficit. However, when animals were trained on a non-episodic version of the same task, hippocampal lesions had no effect. These results suggest that CA3 and CA1 both contribute to episodic memory processing since lesions to CA3 or CA1 result in an inability to process spatial information episodically, whereas they have no effect on non-episodic information processing.},

NMDARs can significantly contribute to information transfer at synapses particularly during periods of repetitive activity. It is also increasingly recognized that NMDARs participate in dendritic synaptic integration and are critical for generating persistent activity of neural assemblies. Here we review recent advances on the mechanisms and functional consequences of NMDAR plasticity. Given the unique biophysical properties of NMDARs, synaptic plasticity of NMDAR-mediated transmission emerges as a particularly powerful mechanism for the fine tuning of information encoding and storage throughout the brain.},

At this level of granularity stochastic behavior dominates, well-mixed continuum approximations based on concentrations break down and a particle-based approach is more accurate and more efficient. We describe and validate a new version of the open-source MCell simulation program (MCell4), which supports generalized 3D Monte Carlo modeling of diffusion and chemical reaction of discrete molecules and macromolecular complexes in solution, on surfaces representing membranes, and combinations thereof. The main improvements in MCell4 compared to the previous versions, MCell3 and MCell3-R, include a Python interface and native BioNetGen reaction language (BNGL) support. MCell4’s Python interface opens up completely new possibilities of interfacing with external simulators and implementing sophisticated event-driven multiscale/multiphysics simulations. The native BNGL support through a new open-source library libBNG (also introduced in this paper) provides the capability to run a given BNGL model spatially resolved in MCell4 and, with appropriate simplifying assumptions, in the BioNetGen simulation environment, greatly accelerating and simplifying model validation and comparison.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity represents the long lasting activity-related strengthening or weakening of synaptic transmission, whose well-characterized types are the long term potentiation and depression. Despite this classical definition, however, the molecular mechanisms by which synaptic plasticity may occur appear to be extremely complex and various. The post-synaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic synapses is a major site for synaptic plasticity processes and alterations of PSD members have been recently implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases where an impairment of synaptic plasticity has also been reported. Among PSD members, scaffolding proteins have been demonstrated to bridge surface receptors with their intracellular effectors and to regulate receptors distribution and localization both at surface membranes and within the PSD. This review will focus on the molecular physiology and pathophysiology of synaptic plasticity processes, which are tuned by scaffolding PSD proteins and their close related partners, through the modulation of receptor localization and distribution at post-synaptic sites. We suggest that, by regulating both the compartmentalization of receptors along surface membrane and their degradation as well as by modulating receptor trafficking into the PSD, postsynaptic scaffolding proteins may contribute to form distinct signaling micro-domains, whose efficacy in transmitting synaptic signals depends on the dynamic stability of the scaffold, which in turn is provided by relative amounts and post-translational modifications of scaffolding members. The putative relevance for neuropsychiatric diseases and possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the last part of this work.},

Using a CRISPR-based system to delete CaMKII and replace it with mutated forms in single neurons, we have rigorously addressed its various synaptic roles. In brief, basal AMPAR and NMDAR synaptic transmission both require CaMKIIα, but not CaMKIIβ, indicating that, even in the adult, synaptic transmission is determined by the ongoing action of CaMKIIα. While AMPAR transmission requires kinase activity, NMDAR transmission does not, implying a scaffolding role for the CaMKII protein instead. LTP is abolished in the absence of CaMKIIα and/or CaMKIIβ and with an autophosphorylation impaired CaMKIIα (T286A). With the exception of NMDAR synaptic currents, all aspects of CaMKIIα signaling examined require binding to the NMDAR, emphasizing the essential role of this receptor as a master synaptic signaling hub.},

However, a number of serious concerns have been raised recently, questioning whether today’s computational work is adequately reproducible. In principle, it should be possible to specify a computation to sufficient detail that anyone should be able to reproduce it exactly. But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing. Technical barriers to reproducibility are described, extant approaches surveyed, and open areas of research are identified.},

  abstract = {1. Extracellular recordings from hippocampal area CA1 lasting 2-8 h posttetanus were used to evaluate the duration of long-term potentiation (LTP) at two key developmental ages. 2. At day 11 LTP consistently endured for approximately 1 h before declining to baseline by 2.5 h posttetanus. The response could then be repotentiated, and in some cases, the repotentiation lasted longer than the original potentiation. 3. At day 15 two patterns of potentiation were observed. The first pattern was similar to that observed at day 11 in that the potentiation did not persist; however, it did endure for approximately 2-2.5 h before declining to baseline by 4 h posttetanus. In the second pattern the potentiation persisted indefinitely; these responses were monitored for 6-8 h posttetanus. 4. These patterns are similar to the temporal phases of LTP that have been revealed in adult rat hippocampus through pharmacological manipulations. They may reflect developmental changes during which the different cellular mechanisms underlying LTP become sequentially activated. 5. These findings are important for several reasons. First, because the different temporal phases of LTP seem to be added stepwise during development, animals of different ages could be used explicitly to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms of these phases in LTP. Second, because LTP is a candidate mechanism for some forms of learning and memory, these results have implications for sequential steps in the ontogeny of learning and memory. Finally, because studies of LTP have used animals of widely varying ages, including these two ages, it is important to consider whether differences in the developmental properties of LTP could influence experimental observations.}

By intention, the 15 FAIR guiding principles do not dictate specific technological implementations, but provide guidance for improving Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of digital resources. This has likely contributed to the broad adoption of the FAIR principles, because individual stakeholder communities can implement their own FAIR solutions. However, it has also resulted in inconsistent interpretations that carry the risk of leading to incompatible implementations. Thus, while the FAIR principles are formulated on a high level and may be interpreted and implemented in different ways, for true interoperability we need to support convergence in implementation choices that are widely accessible and (re)-usable. We introduce the concept of FAIR implementation considerations to assist accelerated global participation and convergence towards accessible, robust, widespread and consistent FAIR implementations. Any self-identified stakeholder community may either choose to reuse solutions from existing implementations, or when they spot a gap, accept the challenge to create the needed solution, which, ideally, can be used again by other communities in the future.

In this paper, I develop a debunking argument against it. My contention is that this belief is unjustified because it is largely due to an off-track process: our attempt to reduce the cognitive dissonance generated by the “meat paradox”. Most meat-eaters believe that it is wrong to harm animals unnecessarily, yet they routinely and deliberately behave in ways that cause great unnecessary suffering to animals. As recent research suggests, this practical inconsistency puts them in an unpleasant state of dissonance, which they try to escape by resolving the paradox. And they do so in part by adopting the speciesist belief—if animal suffering matters much less than human suffering, then harming animals cannot be so wrong after all. Since this belief-forming process does not track moral truth, I conclude that we are not justified in believing that human interests matter more than the similar interests of non-humans.},

  abstract = {A range of recent debates in geography have considered responsibility and/or critical practice, including the connections between knowledge production, ethics and politics. Taking our cue from these debates, this paper explores the question and limits of responsibility in research across a global North–South divide. Emerging from reflections on our own research projects, we interrogate a central challenge of postcolonial knowledge production by examining two limits to, and constraints upon, responsible knowledge production across the global North–South: abstraction and representation, and learning. First, we argue that the forms of distancing that can inhere in abstraction risk sidestepping the concerns of ‘the field’ by decontextualising places/constituencies/ideas. This involves considering the representational economies at stake in negotiating slippages of distance or practices of learning. We argue in favour of creative and generative representations that might be produced through more participatory and uncertain practices. Second, we explore an ethical and indirect conception of learning as a basis for alternative modes of engagement with communities and researchers in research practice. In making this argument, we do not offer a kind of formula for responsibility in research nor do we argue simply for research to be more ‘relevant’. Instead, and alert to our own positions of privilege, we seek to draw attention to these two limits to responsible praxis in the academic knowledge production process precisely because they can act as important registers for thinking through the politics of conducting research between different and sometimes co-constituting cultures of knowledge production.},

The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

For the exploration of such systems, computer simulation has proved to be an invaluable tool, and many researchers in this field have developed sophisticated computational models for application to specific cell biological questions. However, it is often difficult to reconcile conflicting computational results that use different approaches to describe the same phenomenon. To address this issue systematically, we have defined a series of computational test cases ranging from very simple to moderately complex, varying key features of dimensionality, reaction type, reaction speed, crowding, and cell size. We then quantified how explicit spatial and/or stochastic implementations alter outcomes, even when all methods use the same reaction network, rates, and concentrations. For simple cases, we generally find minor differences in solutions of the same problem. However, we observe increasing discordance as the effects of localization, dimensionality reduction, and irreversible enzymatic reactions are combined. We discuss the strengths and limitations of commonly used computational approaches for exploring cell biological questions and provide a framework for decision making by researchers developing new models. As computational power and speed continue to increase at a remarkable rate, the dream of a fully comprehensive computational model of a living cell may be drawing closer to reality, but our analysis demonstrates that it will be crucial to evaluate the accuracy of such models critically and systematically.},

Here, we directly measure the rate of NMDAR channel opening in response to depolarizations at different times after brief (1 ms) and sustained (4.6 s) applications of glutamate to nucleated patches from neocortical pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of Mg2+ unblock were found to be non-instantaneous and complex, consisting of a prominent fast component (time constant ∼100 μs) and slower components (time constants 4 and ∼300 ms), the relative amplitudes of which depended on the timing of the depolarizing pulse. Fitting a kinetic model to these data indicated that Mg2+ not only blocks the NMDAR channel, but reduces both the open probability and affinity for glutamate, while enhancing desensitization. These effects slow the rate of NMDAR channel opening in response to depolarization in a time-dependent manner such that the slower components of Mg2+ unblock are enhanced during depolarizations at later times after glutamate application. One physiological consequence of this is that brief depolarizations occurring earlier in time after glutamate application are better able to open NMDAR channels. This finding has important implications for spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP), where the precise (millisecond) timing of action potentials relative to synaptic inputs determines the magnitude and sign of changes in synaptic strength. Indeed, we find that STDP timing curves of NMDAR channel activation elicited by realistic dendritic action potential waveforms are narrower than expected assuming instantaneous Mg2+ unblock, indicating that slow Mg2+ unblock of NMDAR channels makes the STDP timing window more precise.},

Moreover, unlike other mental processes such as thought, language, and consciousness, learning seemed from the outset to be readily accessible to cellular and molecular analysis. I, therefore, have been curious to know: What changes in the brain when we learn? And, once something is learned, how is that information retained in the brain?

  abstract = {We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during the early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower-dimensional manageable system of closed equations. We found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e., during stimulation), and after that, they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that the learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong, positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. Moreover, we find that such efficiencies drop significantly with increasing the number of spines. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding, and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.},

  abstract = {A detailed and robust mathematical theory and modeling paradigms with discrete functions and relationships within diverse regions of the brain are essential to analyze the operations of neural system. Although the complete actions and events of nervous systems, with its causal entities, cannot be revealed by mathematical or statistical systems only, a requirement of dynamic and powerful virtual modeling paradigms is crucial for processing them. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as machine learning and deep learning have proven to be the unrivaled approaches for solving problems pertaining to numerous recognition systems. Computer vision systems integrated with enhanced neural network methods can provide qualitative and better results in the medical and healthcare sector to a large extent. The study of multifaceted models is therefore organized by discussing the current state-of-the-art in the field of computational neuroscience by focusing on the currently available tools and software resources for effectively carrying out the research work in this domain. The sources of relevant databases and online repositories consisting of brain-related imaging data for detailed research and investigation have also been comprehensively described.},

  abstract = {Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction‐based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint‐based models, reaction‐diffusion models, logical network models, and rule‐based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single‐cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.},

First, the two proteins comigrate on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Second, iodinated tryptic peptide maps of the two are identical. Finally, a monoclonal antibody (6G9) that was raised against the protein kinase binds on immunoblots to a single 50 kDa band in crude brain homogenates and to both the alpha subunit of the purified kinase and the mPSDp from postsynaptic density fractions. The purified kinase holoenzyme also contains a 60-kDa subunit termed beta. A comparison of the peptide map of beta with the maps of 60-kDa proteins from the postsynaptic density fraction suggests that beta is present there but is not the only protein present in this molecular weight range. These results indicate that the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is a major constituent of the postsynaptic density fraction and thus may be a component of type I postsynaptic densities.},

  abstract = {Calcium calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is sequestered in dendritic spines within seconds upon synaptic stimulation. The program Smoldyn was used to develop scenarios of single molecule CaMKII diffusion and binding in virtual dendritic spines. We first validated simulation of diffusion as a function of spine morphology. Additional cellular structures were then incorporated to simulate binding of CaMKII to the post-synaptic density (PSD); binding to cytoskeleton; or their self-aggregation. The distributions of GFP tagged native and mutant constructs in dissociated hippocampal neurons were measured to guide quantitative analysis. Intra-spine viscosity was estimated from fluorescence recovery after photo-bleach (FRAP) of red fluorescent protein. Intra-spine mobility of the GFP-CaMKIIα constructs was measured, with hundred-millisecond or better time resolution, from FRAP of distal spine tips in conjunction with fluorescence loss (FLIP) from proximal regions. Different FRAP \textbackslash{} FLIP profiles were predicted from our Scenarios and provided a means to differentiate binding to the PSDs from self-aggregation. The predictions were validated by experiments. Simulated fits of the Scenarios provided estimates of binding and rate constants. We utilized these values to assess the role of self-aggregation during the initial response of native CaMKII holoenzymes to stimulation. The computations revealed that self-aggregation could provide a concentration-dependent switch to amplify CaMKII sequestration and regulate its activity depending on its occupancy of the actin cytoskeleton.},

  abstract = {IntroductionPositive results have a greater chance of being published and outcomes that are statistically significant have a greater chance of being fully reported. One consequence of research underreporting is that it may influence the sample of studies that is available for a meta-analysis. Smaller studies are often characterized by larger effects in published meta-analyses, which can be possibly explained by publication bias. We investigated the association between the statistical significance of the results and the probability of being included in recent meta-analyses. MethodsFor meta-analyses of clinical trials, we defined the relative risk as the ratio of the probability of including statistically significant results favoring the treatment to the probability of including other results. For meta-analyses of other studies, we defined the relative risk as the ratio of the probability of including biologically plausible statistically significant results to the probability of including other results. We applied a Bayesian selection model for meta-analyses that included at least 30 studies and were published in four major general medical journals (BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and PLOS Medicine) between 2008 and 2012. ResultsWe identified 49 meta-analyses. The estimate of the relative risk was greater than one in 42 meta-analyses, greater than two in 16 meta-analyses, greater than three in eight meta-analyses, and greater than five in four meta-analyses. In 10 out of 28 meta-analyses of clinical trials, there was strong evidence that statistically significant results favoring the treatment were more likely to be included. In 4 out of 19 meta-analyses of observational studies, there was strong evidence that plausible statistically significant outcomes had a higher probability of being included. ConclusionsPublication bias was present in a substantial proportion of large meta-analyses that were recently published in four major medical journals.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the impact of a higher publishing probability for statistically significant positive outcomes on the false-positive rate in meta-analysis. Design Meta-analyses of different sizes (N=10, N=20, N=50 and N=100), levels of heterogeneity and levels of publication bias were simulated. Primary and secondary outcome measures The type I error rate for the test of the mean effect size (ie, the rate at which the meta-analyses showed that the mean effect differed from 0 when it in fact equalled 0) was estimated. Additionally, the power and type I error rate of publication bias detection methods based on the funnel plot were estimated. Results In the presence of a publication bias characterised by a higher probability of including statistically significant positive results, the meta-analyses frequently concluded that the mean effect size differed from zero when it actually equalled zero. The magnitude of the effect of publication bias increased with an increasing number of studies and between-study variability. A higher probability of including statistically significant positive outcomes introduced little asymmetry to the funnel plot. A publication bias of a sufficient magnitude to frequently overturn the meta-analytic conclusions was difficult to detect by publication bias tests based on the funnel plot. When statistically significant positive results were four times more likely to be included than other outcomes and a large between-study variability was present, more than 90\% of the meta-analyses of 50 and 100 studies wrongly showed that the mean effect size differed from zero. In the same scenario, publication bias tests based on the funnel plot detected the bias at rates not exceeding 15\%. Conclusions This study adds to the evidence that publication bias is a major threat to the validity of medical research and supports the usefulness of efforts to limit publication bias.},

  abstract = {Stress can disturb cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and consequently limit the quality of human life. This review provides an overview of the neurobiology of stress–memory interactions, and presents a neural–endocrine model to explain how stress modifies hippocampal functioning. Stress can be defined as a condition in which an individual is aroused by an aversive situation, and its consequences are influenced greatly by the individual's perception of his or her ability to control the presence or intensity of the stimulus. The hippocampus is involved in both memory and the neuroendocrine regulation of stress hormones. Hippocampal functions, such as learning and memory, are susceptible to disruption by stress, mediated in part by the activation of type II corticosteroid (glucocorticoid) receptors. The primary physiological model of memory is long-term potentiation (LTP), and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological studies have shown that stress interferes with the induction of hippocampal LTP. In addition to affecting synaptic plasticity and memory, stress and corticosterone have been shown to alter hippocampal dendritic morphology and inhibit neurogenesis in the adult brain, which can also have an impact on memory-related functioning. The full expression of stress effects on the hippocampus seems to require co-activation of the amygdala and hippocampus, in concert with the direct actions on the hippocampus of neuromodulators, such as corticosterone, 5-hydroxytryptamine, opiates and corticotropin-releasing factor. The key assumption of the neuroendocrine model is that alterations in hippocampal functioning after stress are due to an excessive activity exerted by the amygdala on the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Kim and Ziff examine the molecular mechanism of synaptic scaling, showing that inhibition of neuronal excitability reduces calcium influx into neurons, resulting in decreased calcineurin activity. This leads to increased surface expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors as a homeostatic response., Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a negative-feedback mechanism for compensating excessive excitation or inhibition of neuronal activity. When neuronal activity is chronically suppressed, neurons increase synaptic strength across all affected synapses via synaptic scaling. One mechanism for this change is alteration of synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) accumulation. Although decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels caused by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity are believed to be an important trigger of synaptic scaling, the mechanism of Ca2+-mediated AMPAR-dependent synaptic scaling is not yet understood. Here, we use dissociated mouse cortical neurons and employ Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiological, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to describe a novel mechanism in which homeostasis of Ca2+ signaling modulates activity deprivation-induced synaptic scaling by three steps: (1) suppression of neuronal activity decreases somatic Ca2+ signals; (2) reduced activity of calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, increases synaptic expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CPARs) by stabilizing GluA1 phosphorylation; and (3) Ca2+ influx via CPARs restores CREB phosphorylation as a homeostatic response by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the ER. Therefore, we suggest that synaptic scaling not only maintains neuronal stability by increasing postsynaptic strength but also maintains nuclear Ca2+ signaling by synaptic expression of CPARs and ER Ca2+ propagation., Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that normalizes the strength of synapses (the structure that allows nerve cells to communicate) and is triggered by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity. Although extensive studies have been conducted, the molecular mechanism of this synaptic adaptation is not understood. Using cultured cortical neurons, we show that chronic inhibition of neuronal activity reduces calcium influx into neurons, which, in turn, decreases the activity of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. These changes lead to an increase in GluA1-containing, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which mediate communication at the synapse. Newly inserted calcium-permeable AMPA receptors restore calcium currents, which enhance synaptic strength and recover calcium signaling. We also show that inhibition or activation of calcineurin activity is sufficient to induce or block synaptic scaling, respectively, suggesting that calcineurin is an important mediator of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Taken together, our findings show that synaptic scaling is a homeostatic process that not only enhances synaptic transmission but also maintains calcium signaling in neurons under activity deprivation.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP) about a half-century ago, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been one of the most extensively studied components of the molecular machinery that regulate plasticity. This unique dodecameric kinase complex plays pivotal roles in LTP by phosphorylating substrates through elaborate regulatory mechanisms, and is known to be both necessary and sufficient for LTP. In addition to acting as a kinase, CaMKII has been postulated to have structural roles because of its extraordinary abundance and diverse interacting partners. It now is becoming clear that these two functions of CaMKII cooperate closely for the induction of both functional and structural synaptic plasticity of dendritic spines. Because of its extraordinary abundance within neuronal cells, calmodulin kinase CaMKII has been believed to act as a structural protein as well as an enzyme during synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarized studies in CaMKII field and provide an insight into how enzymatic and structural functions of CaMKII cooperate with each other for long-term potentiation (LTP) in neurons. This article is part of a mini review series: “Synaptic Function and Dysfunction in Brain Diseases”.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores the findability and discoverability of qualitative research data within the social sciences, focusing on three key domains: discipline-specific repositories, scholarly journal articles, and scholarly journals. Employing an explorative and descriptive approach, the study investigates the extent to which data management practices support the finding and discovery of qualitative datasets. The research identifies that while repositories commonly use persistent identifiers (PIDs) and discipline-specific metadata standards, the availability of advanced search functionalities remains limited, which may hinder data findability. The study also highlights a concerning scarcity of data availability statements in scholarly articles, with only 17\% including such statements, and reveals that data sharing is often impeded by ethical constraints. Furthermore, a significant gap was found between the datasets stored in repositories and their representation in scholarly literature, underscoring the need for better integration of repository-held data into academic discourse. The findings suggest that both repositories and journals must enhance their practices to promote the visibility of qualitative research data, with recommendations for improved search tools, stricter enforcement of data availability statement policies, and stronger linkages between datasets and scholarly publications. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on open science and the challenges associated with qualitative data sharing in the social sciences.},

However, in larger networks it is hampered by the combinatorial explosion of possible routes. In this work we give some estimations on the combinatorial complexity including theoretical upper bounds for the number of elementary flux modes in a network of a given size. In a case study, we computed the elementary modes in the central metabolism of Escherichia coli while utilizing four different substrates. Interestingly, although the number of modes occurring in this complex network can exceed half a million, it is still far below the upper bound. Hence, to a certain extent, pathway analysis of central catabolism is feasible to assess network properties such as flexibility and functionality.},

  abstract = {NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that assemble into tetrameric receptor complexes composed of glycine-binding GluN1 and GluN3 subunits (GluN3A-B) and glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-D). NMDA receptors can assemble as GluN1/N2 receptors and as GluN3-containing NMDA receptors, which are either glutamate/glycine-activated triheteromeric GluN1/N2/N3 receptors or glycine-activated diheteromeric GluN1/N3 receptors. The glycine-binding GluN1 and GluN3 subunits display strikingly different pharmacological selectivity profiles. However, the pharmacological characterization of GluN3-containing receptors has been hampered by the lack of methods and pharmacological tools to study GluN3 subunit pharmacology in isolation. Here, we have developed a method to study the pharmacology of GluN3 subunits in recombinant diheteromeric GluN1/N3 receptors by mutating the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket in GluN1. This method is suitable for performing compound screening and characterization of structure-activity relationship studies on GluN3 ligands. We have performed a virtual screen of the orthosteric binding site of GluN3A in the search for antagonists with selectivity for GluN3 subunits. In the subsequent pharmacological evaluation of 99 selected compounds, we identified 6-hydroxy-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5(4H)-one (TK80) a novel competitive antagonist with preference for the GluN3B subunit. Serendipitously, we also identified [2-hydroxy-5-((4-(pyridin-3-yl)thiazol-2-yl)amino]benzoic acid (TK13) and 4-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (TK30), two novel non-competitive GluN3 antagonists. These findings demonstrate that structural differences between the orthosteric binding site of GluN3 and GluN1 can be exploited to generate selective ligands.},

Sure, animals suffer and die, but that is morally insignificant since the benefits of research incalculably outweigh the evils. Although this utilitarian claim appears straightforward and relatively uncontroversial, it is neither straightforward nor uncontroversial. This defence of animal experimentation is likely to succeed only by rejecting three widely held moral presumptions. We identify these assumptions and explain their relevance to the justification of animal experimentation. We argue that, even if non-human animals have considerably less moral worth than humans, experimentation is justified only if the benefits are overwhelming. By building on and expanding on arguments offered in earlier papers, we show that researchers cannot substantiate their claims on behalf of animal research. We conclude that there is currently no acceptable utilitarian defence of animal experimentation. Moreover, it is unlikely that there could be one. Since most apologists of animal experimentation rely on utilitarian justifications of their practice, it appears that biomedical experimentation on animals is not morally justified.},

In particular, several lines of evidence suggest that reversible phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1, also referred to as GluA1 or GluR-A) plays a role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We previously reported that regulation of serines (S) 831 and 845 on the GluR1 subunit may play a critical role in bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the Schaffer collateral inputs to CA1. Specifically, gene knockin mice lacking both S831 and S845 phosphorylation sites ("double phosphomutants"), where both serine residues were replaced by alanines (A), showed a faster decaying LTP and a deficit in LTD. To determine which of the two phosphorylation sites was responsible for the phenotype, we have now generated two lines of gene knockin mice: one that specifically lacks S831 (S831A mutants) and another that lacks only S845 (S845A mutants). We found that S831A mutants display normal LTP and LTD, whereas S845A mutants show a specific deficit in LTD. Taken together with our previous results from the "double phosphomutants," our data suggest that either S831 or S845 alone may support LTP, whereas the S845 site is critical for LTD expression.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ca\textsuperscript{2+} influx through the\emph{N}-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor leads to activation and postsynaptic accumulation of Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and ultimately to long term potentiation, which is thought to be the physiological correlate of learning and memory. The NMDA receptor also serves as a CaMKII docking site in dendritic spines with high affinity binding sites located on its NR1 and NR2B subunits. We demonstrate that high affinity binding of CaMKII to NR1 requires autophosphorylation of Thr\textsuperscript{286}. This autophosphorylation reduces the off rate to a level (\emph{t}\textsubscript{½} = ∼23 min) that is similar to that observed for dissociation of the T286D mutant CaMKII (\emph{t}\textsubscript{½} = ∼30 min) from spines after its glutamate-induced accumulation (Shen, K., Teruel, M. N., Connor, J. H., Shenolikar, S., and Meyer, T. (2000) \emph{Nat. Neurosci.} 3, 881–886). CaMKII as well as the previously identified NR1 binding partners calmodulin and α-actinin bind to the short C-terminal portion of the C0 region of NR1. Like Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin, autophosphorylated CaMKII competes with α-actinin-2 for binding to NR1. We conclude that the NR1 C0 region is a key site for recruiting CaMKII to the postsynaptic site, where it may act in concert with calmodulin to modulate the stimulatory role of α-actinin interaction with the NMDA receptor.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of neuroscience has gone through rapid experimental advances and a significant increase in the use of quantitative and computational methods. This growth has created a need for clearer analyses of the theory and modeling approaches used in the field. This issue is particularly complex in neuroscience because the field studies phenomena that cross a wide range of scales and often require consideration at varying degrees of abstraction, from precise biophysical interactions to the computations they implement. We argue that a pragmatic perspective of science, in which descriptive, mechanistic, and normative models and theories each play a distinct role in defining and bridging levels of abstraction, will facilitate neuroscientific practice. This analysis leads to methodological suggestions, including selecting a level of abstraction that is appropriate for a given problem, identifying transfer functions to connect models and data, and the use of models themselves as a form of experiment.},

  abstract = {This report analyzes long term potentiation (LTP) and associative interactions between synapses of the ipsilateral and crossed entorhinal cortical (EC) pathways to the dentate gyrus (DG). In the anesthetized rat, conditioning stimulation to one EC-DG pathway reliably elicits LTP at the ipsilateral synapses, while the synapses of the collateral, crossed pathway to the contralateral DG do not exhibit LTP. Furthermore, in the DG ipsilateral to the conditioning stimulation the convergent crossed pathway from the contralateral side, which had not been itself conditioned, failed to exhibit heterosynaptic LTP. These results are consistent with a specific ‘synaptic’ localization of the changes responsible for LTP, and suggest that some critical number of synapses must be activated in order to observed LTP. While the crossed EC-DG projection never exhibited LTP when conditioned alone, the crossed input could be potentiated under certain circumstances. Specifically, paired conditioning of ipsi- and contralateral inputs by nearly simultaneous conditioning stimulation of the EC bilaterally results in LTP in the crossed system. Futhermore, this associatively induced LTP of the crossed system can be reversed by subsequent conditioning of the ipsilateral system alone. Successive potentiating and depotentiating sequences are possible using paired and non-paired stimulation procedures even after lesions which prevent neural loops through the EC. The results are interpreted as evidence for a ‘Hebb’ type synapse which has the capability for erasure. This synaptic type is not appropriate for classical conditioning without appendant circuitry, but is suited for other forms of associative learning.},

The local evidence is embodied in this data and concerns the hypotheses of interest for this experiment, whereas the global error rate is a property of the statistical analysis and sampling procedure. It is shown using simple examples that local evidence and global error rates can be, and should be, considered together when making inferences. Power analysis for experimental design for hypothesis testing is explained, along with the more locally focussed expected P-values. Issues relating to multiple testing, HARKing and P-hacking are explained, and it is shown that, in many situations, their effects on local evidence and global error rates are in conflict, a conflict that can always be overcome by a fresh dataset from replication of key experiments. Statistics is complicated, and so is science. There is no singular right way to do either, and universally acceptable compromises may not exist. Statistics offers a wide array of tools for assisting with scientific inference by calibrating uncertainty, but statistical inference is not a substitute for scientific inference.

Here, we show that chronic excitation of the Caenorhabditis elegans O2-sensing neurons during ageing causes a rapid decline of experience-dependent plasticity in response to environmental O2 concentration, whereas sustaining lower activity of O2-sensing neurons retains plasticity with age. We demonstrate that neural activity alters the ageing trajectory in the transcriptome of O2-sensing neurons, and our data suggest that high-activity neurons redirect resources from maintaining plasticity to sustaining continuous firing. Sustaining plasticity with age requires the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ (NCKX) exchanger, whereas the decline of plasticity with age in high-activity neurons acts through calmodulin and the scaffold protein Kidins220. Our findings demonstrate directly that the activity of neurons alters neuronal homeostasis to govern the age-related decline of neural plasticity and throw light on the mechanisms involved.},

  abstract = {In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been observed as an early event prior to the presence of clinical symptoms and is believed to be a crucial factor contributing to AD pathogenesis. Amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) disturb the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated postsynaptic Ca2+ signalling in response to presynaptic stimulation by increasing the availability of extracellular glutamate as well as directly disturbing the NMDARs. The abnormal Ca2+ response can further lead to impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP), an important process in memory formation. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of a CA1 pyramidal dendritic spine and conduct computational experiments. We use this model to mimic alterations by AβOs under AD conditions to investigate how they are involved in the Ca2+ dysregulation in the dendritic spine. The alterations in glutamate availability, as well as NMDAR availability and activity, are studied both individually and globally. The simulation results suggest that alterations in glutamate availability mostly affect the synaptic response and have limited effects on the extrasynaptic receptors. Moreover, overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDARs in AD is unlikely to be induced by presynaptic stimulation, but by upregulation of the resting level of glutamate, possibly resulting from these alterations. Furthermore, internalisation of synaptic NR2A-NMDAR shows greater damage to the postsynaptic Ca2+ response in comparison with the internalisation of NR2B-NMDARs; thus, the suggested neuroprotective role of the latter is very limited during synaptic transmission in AD. We integrate a CaMKII state transition model with the Ca2+ model to further study the effects of alterations of NMDARs in the CaMKII state transition, an important downstream event in the early phase of LTP. The model reveals that cooperation between NR2A- and NR2B-NMDAR is required for LTP induction. Under AD conditions, internalisation of membrane NMDARs is suggested to be the cause of the loss of synapse numbers by disrupting CaMKII-NMDAR formation.},

Of the 33 studies that were included in our review, they involved 1996 participants across six countries, over a 25-year period. The studies highlighted faculty and staff experiences of ableism in academia, which focused on disclosure (i.e., choosing to disclose or not), accommodations (i.e., lack of workplace accommodations and the difficult process for obtaining them) and negative attitudes (i.e., stigma, ableism and exclusion). Twenty-one studies explained the impact of ableism in academia, including a negative effect on physical and mental health, and career development. Coping mechanisms and strategies to address ableism in academia were also described. There is a critical need for more research and attention to the lived experiences of ableism among faculty and staff in academia and the impact that ableism has on their health and well-being.},

  abstract = {Memory involves the storage of information at synapses by an LTP-like process. This information storage is synapse specific and can endure for years despite the turnover of all synaptic proteins. There must, therefore, be special principles that underlie the stability of LTP. Recent experimental results suggest that LTP is maintained by the complex of CaMKII with the NMDAR. Here we consider the specifics of the CaMKII/NMDAR molecular switch, with the goal of understanding the biochemical principles that underlie stable information storage by synapses. Consideration of a variety of experimental results suggests that multiple principles are involved. One switch requirement is to prevent spontaneous transitions from the off to the on state. The highly cooperative nature of CaMKII autophosphorylation by Ca2+ (Hill coefficient of 8) and the fact that formation of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex requires release of CaMKII from actin are mechanisms that stabilize the off state. The stability of the on state depends critically on intersubunit autophosphorylation, a process that restores any loss of pT286 due to phosphatase activity. Intersubunit autophosphorylation is also important in explaining why on state stability is not compromised by protein turnover. Recent evidence suggests that turnover occurs by subunit exchange. Thus, stability could be achieved if a newly inserted unphosphorylated subunit was autophosphorylated by a neighboring subunit. Based on other recent work, we posit a novel mechanism that enhances the stability of the on state by protection of pT286 from phosphatases. We posit that the binding of the NMNDAR to CaMKII forces pT286 into the catalytic site of a neighboring subunit, thereby protecting pT286 from phosphatases. A final principle concerns the role of structural changes. The binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR may act as a tag to organize the binding of further proteins that produce the synapse enlargement that underlies late LTP. We argue that these structural changes not only enhance transmission, but also enhance the stability of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

  abstract = {Synapses are complex because they perform multiple functions, including at least six mechanistically different forms of plasticity. Here, I comment on recent developments regarding these processes. (i) Short-term potentiation (STP), a Hebbian process that requires small amounts of synaptic input, appears to make strong contributions to some forms of working memory. (ii) The rules for long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in CA3 have been clarified: induction does not depend obligatorily on backpropagating sodium spikes but, rather, on dendritic branch-specific N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) spikes. (iii) Late LTP, a process that requires a dopamine signal (and is therefore neoHebbian), is mediated by trans-synaptic growth of the synapse, a growth that occurs about an hour after LTP induction. (iv) LTD processes are complex and include both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic forms. (v) Synaptic scaling produced by changes in activity levels are not primarily cell-autonomous, but rather depend on network activity. (vi) The evidence for distance-dependent scaling along the primary dendrite is firm, and a plausible structural-based mechanism is suggested. Ideas about the mechanisms of synaptic function need to take into consideration newly emerging data about synaptic structure. Recent super-resolution studies indicate that glutamatergic synapses are modular (module size 70–80 nm), as predicted by theoretical work. Modules are trans-synaptic structures and have high concentrations of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor. These modules function as quasi-independent loci of AMPA-mediated transmission and may be independently modifiable, suggesting a new understanding of quantal transmission.

The cellular expression of NR2A and NR2B and the NR2 synaptic binding protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) was examined in the mouse somatosensory cortex and thalamus from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P15 using reverse transcription-PCR, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. The localization of NR2A and NR2B subunits and PSD-95 was then studied at synapses in layer IV of somatosensory cortex and in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus using high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. At both cortical and thalamic synapses, a quantitative switch in the dominant synaptic subunit from NR2B to NR2A was accompanied by a similar change in the cellular expression of NR2A but not of NR2B. Synaptic PSD-95 developed independently, although both NR2A and NR2B colocalized with PSD-95. Displacement of NR2B subunits from synapses was not accompanied by an increase in an extrasynaptic pool of this subunit. Thus, the switch in synaptic NR2 subunit predominance does not occur by changes in expression or displacement from synapses and may reflect the formation of new synapses from which NR2B is lacking.},

  abstract = {Mathematical equations are fundamental to modeling biological networks, but as networks get large and revisions frequent, it becomes difficult to manage equations directly or to combine previously developed models. Multiple simultaneous efforts to create graphical standards, rule‐based languages, and integrated software workbenches aim to simplify biological modeling but none fully meets the need for transparent, extensible, and reusable models. In this paper we describe PySB, an approach in which models are not only created using programs, they are programs. PySB draws on programmatic modeling concepts from little b and ProMot, the rule‐based languages BioNetGen and Kappa and the growing library of Python numerical tools. Central to PySB is a library of macros encoding familiar biochemical actions such as binding, catalysis, and polymerization, making it possible to use a high‐level, action‐oriented vocabulary to construct detailed models. As Python programs, PySB models leverage tools and practices from the open‐source software community, substantially advancing our ability to distribute and manage the work of testing biochemical hypotheses. We illustrate these ideas using new and previously published models of apoptosis.},

To this end, we developed a detailed state model of CaMKII activation and autophosphorylation based on the currently available literature, and constrained it with data from CaMKII autophosphorylation essays. Our model takes exact phosphorylation patterns of CaMKII holoenzymes into account, and is valid at physiologically relevant conditions where the concentrations of calcium and calmodulin are not saturating. Our results strongly suggest that even when bound to less than fully calcium-bound calmodulin, CaMKII is in the active state, and indicate that the autophosphorylation of T286 by an active non-phosphorylated CaMKII subunit is significantly faster than by an autophosphorylated CaMKII subunit. These results imply that CaMKII can be efficiently activated at significantly lower calcium concentrations than previously thought, which may explain how CaMKII gets activated at calcium concentrations existing at synapses in vivo. We also investigated the significance of CaMKII holoenzyme structure on CaMKII autophosphorylation and obtained estimates of previously unknown binding constants.},

Despite being a cornerstone of brain function, questions surrounding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how information is encoded, stored, and recalled remain largely unanswered. One widely held theory is that an engram is formed by a group of neurons that are active during learning, which undergoes biochemical and physical changes to store information in a stable state, and that are later reactivated during recall of the memory. In the past decade, the development of engram labeling methodologies has proven useful to investigate the biology of memory at the molecular and cellular levels. Engram technology allows the study of individual memories associated with particular experiences and their evolution over time, with enough experimental resolution to discriminate between different memory processes: learning (encoding), consolidation (the passage from short-term to long-term memories), and storage (the maintenance of memory in the brain). Here, we review the current understanding of memory formation at a molecular and cellular level by focusing on insights provided using engram technology.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Physiol Rev 84: 87–136, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00014.2003.—One of the most significant challenges in neuroscience is to identify the cellular and molecular processes that underlie learning and memory formation. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding changes that accompany certain forms of acquisition and recall, particularly those forms which require activation of afferent pathways in the hippocampus. This progress can be attributed to a number of factors including well-characterized animal models, well-defined probes for analysis of cell signaling events and changes in gene transcription, and technology which has allowed gene knockout and overexpression in cells and animals. Of the several animal models used in identifying the changes which accompany plasticity in synaptic connections, long-term potentiation (LTP) has received most attention, and although it is not yet clear whether the changes that underlie maintenance of LTP also underlie memory consolidation, significant advances have been made in understanding cell signaling events that contribute to this form of synaptic plasticity. In this review, emphasis is focused on analysis of changes that occur after learning, especially spatial learning, and LTP and the value of assessing these changes in parallel is discussed. The effect of different stressors on spatial learning/memory and LTP is emphasized, and the review concludes with a brief analysis of the contribution of studies, in which transgenic animals were used, to the literature on memory/learning and LTP.},

  abstract = {Background: Prior studies implying associations between receipt of commercial funding and positive (significant and/or pro-industry) research outcomes have analyzed only published papers, which is an insufficiently robust approach for assessing publication bias. In this study, we tested the following hypotheses regarding orthopaedic manuscripts submitted for review: (1) nonscientific variables, including receipt of commercial funding, affect the likelihood that a peer-reviewed submission will conclude with a report of a positive study outcome, and (2) positive outcomes and other, nonscientific variables are associated with acceptance for publication.           Methods: All manuscripts about hip or knee arthroplasty that were submitted to The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume, over seventeen months were evaluated to determine the study design, quality, and outcome. Analyses were carried out to identify associations between scientific factors (sample size, study quality, and level of evidence) and study outcome as well as between non-scientific factors (funding source and country of origin) and study outcome. Analyses were also performed to determine whether outcome, scientific factors, or nonscientific variables were associated with acceptance for publication.           Results: Two hundred and nine manuscripts were reviewed. Commercial funding was not found to be associated with a positive study outcome (p = 0.668). Studies with a positive outcome were no more likely to be published than were those with a negative outcome (p = 0.410). Studies with a negative outcome were of higher quality (p = 0.003) and included larger sample sizes (p = 0.05). Commercially funded (p = 0.027) and United States-based (p = 0.020) studies were more likely to be published, even though those studies were not associated with higher quality, larger sample sizes, or lower levels of evidence (p = 0.24 to 0.79).           Conclusions: Commercially funded studies submitted for review were not more likely to conclude with a positive outcome than were nonfunded studies, and studies with a positive outcome were no more likely to be published than were studies with a negative outcome. These findings contradict those of most previous analyses of published (rather than submitted) research. Commercial funding and the country of origin predict publication following peer review beyond what would be expected on the basis of study quality. Studies with a negative outcome, although seemingly superior in quality, fared no better than studies with a positive outcome in the peer-review process; this may result in inflation of apparent treatment effects when the published literature is subjected to meta-analysis.},

In this process, long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely considered as one of the major cellular mechanisms modifying synaptic strength. It can be classified into early phase LTP (E-LTP) and late phase LTP (L-LTP) based on its duration. Using genetically modified mice, investigators have recognized the critical role of CaMKII in E-LTP and memory. However, its function in L-LTP, which is strongly dependent on gene transcription and protein synthesis, is still unclear.

Hence, information from a combination of techniques is required. A greater understanding of the time and concentration-dependent mechanisms, underlying the interactions between chemicals and biological systems, and the sequence of events that can lead to apical effects, will help to move forward the science of reducing and replacing animal experiments. In silico modelling, in vitro assays, high-throughput screening, organ-on-a-chip technology, omics and mathematical biology, can provide complementary information to develop a complete picture of the potential response of an organism to a chemical stressor. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and systems biology frameworks enable relevant information from diverse sources to be logically integrated. While individual researchers do not need to be experts across all disciplines, it is useful to have a fundamental understanding of what other areas of science have to offer, and how knowledge can be integrated with other disciplines. The purpose of this review is to provide those who are unfamiliar with predictive in silico tools, with a fundamental understanding of the underlying theory. Current applications, software, barriers to acceptance, new developments and the use of integrated approaches are all discussed, with additional resources being signposted for each of the topics.},

  abstract = {Memory formation transpires to be by activation and persistent modification of synapses. A chain of biochemical events accompany synaptic activation and culminate in memory formation. These biochemical events are steered by interplay and modulation of various synaptic proteins, achieved by conformational changes and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these proteins. Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are synaptic proteins whose interactions play a pivotal role in learning and memory process. Catalytic activity of CaMKII is modulated upon its interaction with the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR. The structural basis of this interaction is not clearly understood. We have investigated the role of Glu60 of α-CaMKII, a conserved residue present in the ATP binding region of kinases, in the regulation of catalysis of CaMKII by GluN2B. Mutation of Glu60 to Gly exerts different effects on the kinetic parameters of phosphorylation of GluN2B and GluN2A, of which only GluN2B binds to the T-site of CaMKII. GluN2B induced modulation of the kinetic parameters of peptide substrate was altered in the E60G mutant. The mutation almost abolished the modulation of the apparent Km value for protein substrate. However, although kinetic parameters for ATP were altered by mutating Glu60, modulation of the apparent Km value for ATP by GluN2B seen in WT was exhibited by the E60G mutant of α-CaMKII. Hence our results posit that the communication of the T-site of CaMKII with protein substrate binding region of active site is mediated through Glu60 while the communication of the T-site with the ATP binding region is not entirely dependent on Glu60.},

Input/output curves and a full-range paired-pulse study enabled determining the optimal intensities and inter-stimulus intervals for evoking paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or depression (PPD) at the CA3-CA1 synapse. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by HFS lasted ≈10 days. HFS-induced LTP evoked an initial depression of basal PPF. Recovery of PPF baseline values was a steady and progressive process lasting ≈20 days, i.e., longer than the total duration of the LTP. In a subsequent series of experiments, we checked whether PPF was affected similarly during activity-dependent synaptic changes. Animals were conditioned using a trace paradigm, with a tone as a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an electrical shock to the trigeminal nerve as an unconditioned stimulus (US). A pair of pulses (40 ms interval) was presented to the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway to evoke field EPSPs (fEPSPs) during the CS-US interval. Basal PPF decreased steadily across conditioning sessions (i.e., in the opposite direction to that during LTP), reaching a minimum value during the 10th conditioning session. Thus, LTP and classical eyeblink conditioning share some presynaptic mechanisms, but with an opposite evolution. Furthermore, PPF and PPD might play a homeostatic role during long-term plastic changes at the CA3-CA1 synapse.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Novice users face significant challenges while installing and using Python packages in an HPC environment. Due to the inherent design of tools like Pip and Conda and how packages look for libraries, installing Python packages as a non-root user is complicated and often leads to broken packages with conflicting dependencies. With the growing popularity of Python in the HPC community, supporting users with their package installation needs is an evolving issue for the HPC center staff. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of conda-env-mod-a tool for simplifying the installation and use of Python packages in HPC clusters. conda-env-mod simplifies and streamlines the creation of virtual environments and provides users with environment modules for activating the environments. Users can install individual packages into isolated environments reducing chances of conflict (both current and future) and can activate multiple environments using modules as needed. After users load necessary modules, they can simply run pip and conda to install packages just like they would on their desktop. It also helps create Jupyter kernels and allows users to use external packages in a central JupyterHub installation with ease. conda-env-mod hides the complexity of configuring the package managers and setting up the users' runtime environments and, thereby, reduces the barriers for novice Python users. Over the last three months (June-August, 2020), more than 160 users have used conda-env-mod to install and manage custom Python packages, while our deep learning package installations, facilitated by conda-env-mod, have been used by 60 plus users.},

We built a biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity describing CaMKII, PKA, and PKC pathways and their contribution to synaptic potentiation or depression. We developed a statistical AMPA-receptor-tetramer model, which permits the estimation of the AMPA-receptor-mediated maximal synaptic conductance based on numbers of GluR1s and GluR2s predicted by the biochemical signalling model. We show that our model reproduces neuromodulator-gated spike-timing-dependent plasticity as observed in the visual cortex and can be fit to data from many cortical areas, uncovering the biochemical contributions of the pathways pinpointed by the underlying experimental studies. Our model explains the dependence of different forms of plasticity on the availability of different proteins and can be used for the study of mental disorder-associated impairments of cortical plasticity.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is the most abundant kinase within excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. It interacts with and phosphorylates a large number of synaptic proteins, including major ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), to constitutively and/or activity-dependently regulate trafficking, subsynaptic localization, and function of the receptors. Among iGluRs, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a direct target of CaMKII. By directly binding to an intracellular C-terminal (CT) region of NMDAR GluN2B subunits, CaMKII phosphorylates a serine residue (S1303) in the GluN2B CT. CaMKII also phosphorylates a serine site (S831) in the CT of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors. This phosphorylation enhances channel conductance and is critical for synaptic plasticity. In addition to iGluRs, CaMKII binds to the proximal CT region of mGluR1a, which enables the kinase to phosphorylate threonine 871. Agonist stimulation of mGluR1a triggers a CaMKII-mediated negative feedback to facilitate endocytosis and desensitization of the receptor. CaMKII also binds to the mGluR5 CT. This binding seems to anchor and accumulate inactive CaMKII at synaptic sites. Active CaMKII dissociates from mGluR5 and may then bind to adjacent GluN2B to mediate the mGluR5-NMDAR coupling. Together, glutamate receptors serve as direct substrates of CaMKII. By phosphorylating these receptors, CaMKII plays a central role in controlling the number and activity of the modified receptors and determining the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission.},

Calcium input currents are modeled after experimental observations, and existing models of calmodulin and CaMKII autophosphorylation are used. After calibration against CaMKII activation data in the absence of chelators, CaMKII activation dynamics due to synaptic input via n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors are qualitatively accounted for in the presence of the chelators EGTA and BAPTA without additional adjustments to the model. To account for CaMKII activation dynamics during spine depolarization with added EGTA or BAPTA, the model invokes the modulation of CaV2.3 (R-type) voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) currents observed in the presence of EGTA or BAPTA. To our knowledge, this is a novel explanation for the increased CaMKII activation seen in dendritic spines with added EGTA, and suggests that differential modulation of VDCCs by EGTA and BAPTA offers an alternative or complementary explanation for other experimental results in which addition of EGTA or BAPTA produces different effects.

This subunit switch alters NMDAR function, influences synaptic plasticity, and its dysregulation is associated with neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms driving the subunit switch are not known. Here we show in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons that the NR2B- to NR2A switch driven acutely by activity requires activation of NMDARs and mGluR5, involves PLC, Ca2+ release from IP3R-dependent stores and PKC activity. In mGluR5 knock-out mice the developmental NR2B-NR2A switch in CA1 is deficient. Moreover, in visual cortex of mGluR5 knock-out mice the NR2B-NR2A switch evoked in vivo by visual experience is absent. Thus we establish that mGluR5 and NMDARs are required for the activity-dependent NR2B-NR2A switch and play a critical role in experience-dependent regulation of NMDAR subunit composition in vivo.},

Although the tools and languages novices use for writing programs today are notably different from those employed decades earlier, the basic problem-solving and pragmatic skills necessary to debug them effectively are largely similar. Hence, an understanding of the previous work on debugging can offer computer science educators insights into how to improve contemporary learning and teaching of debugging and may suggest directions for future research into this important area. This overview of the debugging literature is organized around four questions relevant to computer science educators and education researchers: What causes bugs to occur? What types of bugs occur? What is the debugging process? How can we improve the learning and teaching of debugging? We conclude with suggestions on using the existing literature both to facilitate pedagogical improvements to debugging education and to offer guidance for future research.},

  abstract = {T cell development is regulated at two critical checkpoints that involve signaling events through the TCR. These signals are propagated by kinases of the Src and Syk families, which activate several adaptor molecules to trigger Ca(2+) release and, in turn, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. In this study, we show that a constitutively active form of CaMKII antagonizes TCR signaling and impairs positive selection of thymocytes in mice. Following TCR engagement, active CaMKII decreases TCR-mediated CD3zeta chain phosphorylation and ZAP70 recruitment, preventing further downstream events. Therefore, we propose that CaMKII belongs to a negative-feedback loop that modulates the strength of the TCR signal through the tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP-2).},

  abstract = {Brain synapses are neuronal structures of the greatest interest. For a long time, however, the knowledge about them was variable, and interest was mostly focused on their pre-synaptic portions, especially neurotransmitter release from axon terminals. In the present review interest is focused on post-synapses, the structures receiving and converting pre-synaptic messages. Upon further modulation, such messages are transferred to dendritic fibers. Dendrites are profoundly different from axons; they are shorter and of variable thickness. Their post-synapses are of two types. Those called flat/intended/aspines, integrated into dendritic fibers, are very frequent in inhibitory neurons. The spines, small and stemming protrusions, connected to dendritic fibers by their necks, are present in almost all excitatory neurons. Several structures and functions including the post-synaptic densities and associated proteins, the nanoscale mechanisms of compartmentalization, the cytoskeletons of actin and microtubules, are analogous in the two post-synaptic forms. However other properties, such as plasticity and its functions of learning and memory, are largely distinct. Several properties of spines, including emersion from dendritic fibers, growth, change in shape and decreases in size up to disappearance, are specific. Spinal heads correspond to largely independent signaling compartments. They are motile, their local signaling is fast, however transport through their thin necks is slow. When single spines are activated separately, their dendritic effects are often lacking; when multiple spines are activated concomitantly, their effects take place. Defects of post-synaptic responses, especially those of spines, take place in various brain diseases. Here alterations affecting symptoms and future therapy are shown to occur in neurodegenerative diseases and autism spectrum disorders.},

Although science and ethics have conventionally been considered different, it is herewith proposed that they are essentially similar. The proposal set henceforth is to create a new ethics rooted in science: scientific ethics. Science has firm axiological foundations and searches for truth (as a value, axiology) and knowledge (epistemology). Hence, science cannot be value neutral. Looking at standard scientific principles, it is possible to construct a scientific ethic (that is, an ethical framework based on scientific methods and rules), which can be applied to all sciences. These intellectual standards include the search for truth (honesty and its derivatives), human dignity (and by reflection the dignity of all animals) and respect for life. Through these it is thence achievable to draft a foundation of a ethics based purely on science and applicable beyond the confines of science. A few applications of these will be presented. Scientific ethics can have vast applications in other fields even in non scientific ones.},

By fluorescence emission anisotropy, the affinity of CaM kinase for dansylated calmodulin was measured and found to increase 1000 times after autophosphorylation of the threonine at position 286 of the protein. Autophosphorylation markedly slowed the release of bound calcium-calmodulin; the release time increased from less than a second to several hundred seconds. In essence, calmodulin is trapped by autophosphorylation. The shift in affinity does not occur in a site-directed mutant in which threonine at position 286 has been replaced by a non-phosphorylatable amino acid. These experiments demonstrate the existence of a new state in which calmodulin is bound to CaM kinase even though the concentration of calcium is basal. Calmodulin trapping provides for molecular potentiation of calcium transients and may enable detection of their frequency.}

These changes suggest a mechanism by which the kinase could act as a calcium-triggered molecular switch. Incorporation of 3-12 of a possible total of 30 phosphate groups per holoenzyme causes kinase activity toward exogenous substrates as well as autophosphorylation itself to become independent of calcium. Thus, kinase activity could be prolonged beyond the duration of an initial activating calcium signal. The calcium-independent autophosphorylation could further prolong the active state by opposing dephosphorylation by cellular phosphatases.},

  abstract = {Molecular switches have been implicated in the storage of information in biological systems. For small structures such as synapses, these switches are composed of only a few molecules and stochastic fluctuations are therefore of importance. Such fluctuations could potentially lead to spontaneous switch reset that would limit the lifetime of information storage. We have analyzed a model of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) switch implicated in long-term memory in the nervous system. The bistability of this switch arises from autocatalytic autophosphorylation of CaMKII, a reaction that is countered by a saturable phosphatase-1-mediated dephosphorylation. We sought to understand the factors that control switch stability and to determine the functional relationship between stability and the number of molecules involved. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the lifetime of states of the switch increase exponentially with the number of CaMKII holoenzymes. Switch stability requires a balance between the kinase and phosphatase rates, and the kinase rate must remain high relative to the rate of protein turnover. Thus, a critical limit on switch stability is set by the observed turnover rate (one per 30 h on average). Our computational results show that, depending on the timescale of fluctuations in enzyme numbers, for a switch composed of about 15 CaMKII holoenzymes, the stable persistent activation can span from a few years to a human lifetime.},

  abstract = {Purpose – Although many in academe have speculated about the effects of pressure to publish on the management discipline – often referred to as “publish or perish” – prevailing knowledge has been based on anecdotal rather than empirical evidence. The aim of the present paper is to shed light on the perceptions of management faculty regarding the pressure to publish imperative. Design/methodology/approach – The authors surveyed faculty in 104 management departments of AACSB accredited, research‐oriented US business schools to explore the prevalence, sources, and effects of pressure to publish. Findings – Results indicate that pressure to publish affects both tenured and tenure‐track management faculty, although the latter, as a group, feel significantly more pressure than those who are tenured. The primary source of this pressure is faculty themselves who are motivated by the prospects of enhancing their professional reputation, leaving a permanent mark on their profession, and increasing their salary and job mobility. The effects of pressure to publish include heightened stress levels; the marginalization of teaching; and research that may lack relevance, creativity, and innovation. Research limitations/implications – The sample was intentionally restricted to faculty from management departments affiliated with research‐oriented US business schools and does not include faculty from departments that are less research‐oriented and, therefore, would be expected to put less pressure on their faculty to publish. Practical implications – Although the effects of pressure to publish are not necessarily always negative, the paper offers some fundamental suggestions to management (and other) faculty who wish to mitigate the deleterious effects of pressure to publish. Originality/value – Although the findings may not be surprising to more seasoned faculty, to the authors' knowledge this is the first time they have been documented in the published literature. As such, they advance discussions of “publish or perish” beyond mere conjecture and “shared myths” allowing management faculty to more rationally debate its consequences and their implications for academic life.},

In addition to its Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-stimulated kinase activity, it can also bind to a variety of membrane proteins at the synapse and thus exert spatially restricted activity. The abundance of CaMKII in glutamatergic synapse is akin to scaffolding proteins although its prominent function still appears to be that of a kinase. The multimeric structure of CaMKII also confers several functional capabilities on the enzyme. The versatility of the enzyme has prompted hypotheses proposing several roles for the enzyme such as Ca\textsuperscript{2+} signal transduction, memory molecule function and scaffolding.

Using unanesthetized 1- to 12-d-old rats, we report here that the majority of neurons in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) are significantly more active during AS than during either quiet sleep or wakefulness. Neuronal activity typically occurs in phasic bursts, during which most neurons are significantly cross-correlated both within and across the CA1 and DG fields. All AS-active neurons increase their firing rates during periods of myoclonic twitching of the limbs, and a subset of these neurons exhibit a burst of activity immediately after limb twitches, suggesting that the twitches themselves provide sensory feedback to the infant hippocampus, as occurs in the infant spinal cord and neocortex. Finally, the synchronous bursts of neuronal activity are coupled to the emergence of the AS-related hippocampal gamma rhythm during the first postnatal week, as well as the emergence of the AS-related theta rhythm during the second postnatal week. We hypothesize that the phasic motor events of active sleep provide the developing hippocampus with discrete sensory stimulation that contributes to the development and refinement of hippocampal circuits as well as the development of synchronized interactions between hippocampus and neocortex.},

A key issue was identifying the type of knowledge that employers utilise in graduate recruitment. A finding of the study was that information on quality and standards was being used by some employers in a way that could undermine equity and widening participation initiatives. Whereas employers reported that, in initial recruitment, they placed least emphasis on information about quality and standards and most emphasis on graduates' interpersonal and communication skills, over a quarter used league tables/Top 20 lists in their decision-making processes and 80 per cent of employers cited the importance of the reputation of the higher education institution in their decision making about marketing and individual recruitment of graduates. Reputation was based on real or imagined league tables, ‘grapevine’ knowledge, personal, regional and professional networks, performance of past graduates and prejudice against new universities. The hierarchy of opportunity within the labour market often appeared to correspond to a highly stratified higher education sector.},

Blockade of these sites with the drug aminophosphonovaleric acid (AP5) does not detectably affect synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, but prevents the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) following brief high-frequency stimulation4–6. We now report that chronic intraventricular infusion of D, L-AP5 causes a selective impairment of place learning, which is highly sensitive to hippocampal damage7, without affecting visual discrimination learning, which is not8. The L-isomer of AP5 did not produce behavioural effects. AP5 treatment also suppressed LTP in vivo. These results suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in spatial learning, and add support to the hypothesis9–11 that LTP is involved in some, but not all, forms of learning.},

  abstract = {The 2004 EJN Lecture was an attempt to lay out further aspects of a developing neurobiological theory of hippocampal function [Morris, R.G.M., Moser, E.I., Riedel, G., Martin, S.J., Sandin, J., Day, M. \& O'Carroll, C. (2003) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci., 358, 773–786.] These are that (i) activity-dependent synaptic plasticity plays a key role in the automatic encoding and initial storage of attended experience; (ii) the persistence of hippocampal synaptic potentiation over time can be influenced by other independent neural events happening closely in time, an idea with behavioural implications for memory; and (iii) that systems-level consolidation of memory traces within neocortex is guided both by hippocampal traces that have been subject to cellular consolidation and by the presence of organized schema in neocortex into which relevant newly encoded information might be stored. Hippocampal memory is associative and, to study it more effectively than with previous paradigms, a new learning task is described which is unusual in requiring the incidental encoding of flavour–place paired associates, with the readout of successful storage being successful recall of a place given the flavour with which it was paired. NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity is shown to be critical for the encoding and intermediate storage of memory traces in this task, while AMPA receptor-mediated fast synaptic transmission is necessary for memory retrieval. Typically, these rapidly encoded traces decay quite rapidly over time. Synaptic potentiation also decays rapidly, but can be rendered more persistent by a process of cellular consolidation in which synaptic tagging and capture play a key part in determining whether or not it will be persistent. Synaptic tags set at the time of an event, even many trivial events, can capture the products of the synthesis of plasticity proteins set in train by events before, during or even after an event to be remembered. Tag–protein interactions stabilize synaptic potentiation and, by implication, memory. The behavioural implications of tagging are explored. Finally, using a different protocol for flavour–place paired associate learning, it is shown that rats can develop a spatial schema which represents the relative locations of several different flavours of food hidden at places within a familiar space. This schema is learned gradually but, once acquired, enables new paired associates to be encoded and stored in one trial. Their incorporation into the schema prevents rapid forgetting and suggests that schema play a key and hitherto unappreciated role in systems-level memory consolidation. The elements of what may eventually mature into a more formal neurobiological theory of hippocampal memory are laid out as specific propositions with detailed conceptual discussion and reference to recent data.},

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

New technologies, and increased use of more naturalistic observations, have enabled investigators to delve deeply into the structures that mediate episodic memory, particularly the hippocampus, and to track functional and structural interactions among brain regions that support it. Conceptually, episodic memory is increasingly being viewed as subject to lifelong transformations that are reflected in the neural substrates that mediate it. In keeping with this dynamic perspective, research on episodic memory (and the hippocampus) has infiltrated domains, from perception to language and from empathy to problem solving, that were once considered outside its boundaries. Using the component process model as a framework, and focusing on the hippocampus, its subfields, and specialization along its longitudinal axis, along with its interaction with other brain regions, we consider these new developments and their implications for the organization of episodic memory and its contribution to functions in other domains.},

Autophosphorylation of T286 is of special importance because it makes the enzyme active in the absence of Ca2+, providing a biochemical memory that is critical for plasticity. To understand the factors controlling the duration of this state of CaMKII, we studied dephosphorylation of CaMKII in the post-synaptic density (PSD), a structure that defines a neuronal subcompartment critical for plasticity. We found that PSD-resident PP1 can dephosphorylate many sites on CaMKII, but not the T286 site that produces Ca2+-independent activity. This, together with previous work showing that soluble PP2A cannot dephosphorylate PSD CaMKII, provides a novel explanation for the in vivo persistence of T286 phosphorylation: after activated CaMKII translocates from the cytoplasm to the PSD, structural constraints prevent phosphatases from dephosphorylating T286. These results also suggest that the PSD is more than a simple scaffold for synaptic proteins; it may act to regulate the activity of proteins by positioning them in orientations that either prevent or favor specific biochemical reactions.},

As expected from earlier work, only slices of two-week-old animals showed a consistent degree of long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to patterned high frequency stimulation. Several other synaptic properties were found to change during this developmental period. Inhibitory responses were absent in 7–9 day old but not in 12–15 day old neonates. Paired-pulse facilitation and the calcium sensitivity of postsynaptic responses were considerably reduced in 7–9 as compared to 12–15 day old rats. However, phorbol esters and 4-aminopyridine treatment still produced a strong facilitation of field potentials. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) component of responses to single pulse stimulation in low magnesium medium was found to be larger in slices of 7–9 than 12–15 day old or adult animals. At the two time periods examined, trains of high frequency stimulation applied in the presence of regular magnesium elicited an NMDA dependent response. It is concluded that the differences in synaptic properties observed between 7–9 and 12–15 day old neonates may not account for the absence of LTP in the younger animals.},

Here we describe recent work from several laboratories on the various forms of synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.

  abstract = {, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and long-term potentiation (LTP) were discovered within a decade of each other and have been inextricably intertwined ever since. However, like many marriages, it has had its up and downs. Based on the unique biochemical properties of CaMKII, it was proposed as a memory molecule before any physiological linkage was made to LTP. However, as reviewed here, the convincing linkage of CaMKII to synaptic physiology and behavior took many decades. New technologies were critical in this journey, including in vitro brain slices, mouse genetics, single-cell molecular genetics, pharmacological reagents, protein structure, and two-photon microscopy, as were new investigators attracted by the exciting challenge. This review tracks this journey and assesses the state of this marriage 40 years on. The collective literature impels us to propose a relatively simple model for synaptic memory involving the following steps that drive the process: 1) Ca2+ entry through N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates CaMKII. 2) CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation resulting in constitutive, Ca2+-independent activity and exposure of a binding site for the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B. 3) Active CaMKII translocates to the postsynaptic density (PSD) and binds to the cytoplasmic C-tail of GluN2B. 4) The CaMKII-GluN2B complex initiates a structural rearrangement of the PSD that may involve liquid-liquid phase separation. 5) This rearrangement involves the PSD-95 scaffolding protein, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), and their transmembrane AMPAR-regulatory protein (TARP) auxiliary subunits, resulting in an accumulation of AMPARs in the PSD that underlies synaptic potentiation. 6) The stability of the modified PSD is maintained by the stability of the CaMKII-GluN2B complex. 7) By a process of subunit exchange or interholoenzyme phosphorylation CaMKII maintains synaptic potentiation in the face of CaMKII protein turnover. There are many other important proteins that participate in enlargement of the synaptic spine or modulation of the steps that drive and maintain the potentiation. In this review we critically discuss the data underlying each of the steps. As will become clear, some of these steps are more firmly grounded than others, and we provide suggestions as to how the evidence supporting these steps can be strengthened or, based on the new data, be replaced. Although the journey has been a long one, the prospect of having a detailed cellular and molecular understanding of learning and memory is at hand.},

  abstract = {The synapse is a highly organized cellular specialization whose structure and composition are reorganized, both positively and negatively, depending on the strength of input signals. The mechanisms orchestrating these changes are not well understood. A plausible locus for the reorganization of synapse components and structure is actin, because it serves as both cytoskeleton and scaffold for synapses and exists in a dynamic equilibrium between F-actin and G-actin that is modulated bidirectionally by cellular signaling. Using a new FRET-based imaging technique to monitor F-actin/G-actin equilibrium, we show here that tetanic stimulation causes a rapid, persistent shift of actin equilibrium toward F-actin in the dendritic spines of rat hippocampal neurons. This enlarges the spines and increases postsynaptic binding capacity. In contrast, prolonged low-frequency stimulation shifts the equilibrium toward G-actin, resulting in a loss of postsynaptic actin and of structure. This bidirectional regulation of actin is actively involved in protein assembly and disassembly and provides a substrate for bidirectional synaptic plasticity.},

It is highly concentrated in the postsynaptic density fraction, exceeding the amount of any other signal transduction molecules. Because kinase signaling can be amplified by catalytic reaction, why CaMKII exists in such a large quantity has been a mystery. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that CaMKII is capable of bundling F-actin through a stoichiometric interaction. Consistent with this evidence, in hippocampal neurons, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of CaMKII leads to a reduction in the volume of dendritic spine head that is mediated by F-actin dynamics. An overexpression of CaMKII slowed down the actin turnover in the spine head. This activity was associated with beta subunit of CaMKII in a manner requiring its actin-binding and association domains but not the kinase domain. This finding indicates that CaMKII serves as a central signaling molecule in both functional and structural changes during synaptic plasticity.},

CaMKIIβ contains three exons (v1, v3, and v4) not present in the CaMKIIα gene, and two of these exons (v1 and v4) are subject to differential alternative splicing. We show here that CaMKIIβ, but not α, mediated bundling of F-actin filaments in vitro. Most importantly, inclusion of exon v1 was required for CaMKIIβ association with the F-actin cytoskeleton within cells. CaMKIIβe, which is the dominant variant around birth and lacks exon v1 sequences, failed to associate with F-actin. By contrast, CaMKIIβ′, which instead lacks exon v4, associated with F-actin as full-length CaMKIIβ. Previous studies with CaMKIIβ mutants have indicated a role of nonstimulated kinase activity in enhancing dendritic arborization. Here, we show that F-actin–targeted CaMKIIβ, but not α, was able to phosphorylate actin in vitro even by nonstimulated basal activity in absence of Ca2+/CaM. In rat pancreatic islets and in skeletal muscle, the actin-associated CaMKIIβ′ and βM were the predominant variants, respectively. Thus, cytoskeletal targeting may mediate functions of CaMKIIβ variants also outside the nervous system.},

However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using single-particle tracking of AMPARs, we show that CaMKII activation and postsynaptic translocation induce the synaptic trapping of AMPARs diffusing in the membrane. AMPAR immobilization requires both phosphorylation of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin and its binding to PDZ domain scaffolds. It does not depend on the PDZ binding domain of GluA1 AMPAR subunit nor its phosphorylation at Ser831. Finally, CaMKII-dependent AMPAR immobilization regulates short-term plasticity. Thus, NMDA-dependent Ca(2+) influx in the post-synapse triggers a CaMKII- and Stargazin-dependent decrease in AMPAR diffusional exchange at synapses that controls synaptic function.},

  abstract = {Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has long been known to play an important role in learning and memory as well as long term potentiation (LTP). More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of Ca2+ signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over Ca2+ signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed in vivo. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.

As such, public engagement on issues related to animal research, including exploration of public attitudes, provides a means of achieving socially acceptable scientific practice and oversight through an understanding of societal values and concerns. Numerous studies have been conducted to explore public attitudes toward animal use, and more specifically the use of animals in research. This paper reviews relevant literature using three categories of influential factors: personal and cultural characteristics, animal characteristics, and research characteristics. A critique is given of survey style methods used to collect data on public attitudes, and recommendations are given on how best to address current gaps in public attitudes literature.},

  abstract = {CA1 pyramidal cells receive glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex through the perforant path (PP) and from CA3 through Schaffer collaterals (SC). The PP input terminates in the stratum lacunosum moleculare ∼300 μm from the cell body, whereas SC synapses have a more proximal location in the stratum radiatum. We compared the properties of AMPA- and NMDA-mediated transmission at these two inputs. The AMPA-mediated components have linear voltage dependence in both inputs. The reversal potential in the PP is only slightly more positive than in the SC, indicating that distal membrane voltage could be effectively set. The NMDA-mediated responses in the two pathways, however, are very different. The PP exhibits inward rectification, as evidenced by very low outward currents. The rectification persists in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. It cannot be attributed to clamping problems, because large outward AMPA currents can be observed even when conditions are modified to have the AMPA currents kinetically match the NMDA currents. Thus, it appears that the PP NMDA channels have novel properties. A second difference between the PP and SC pathways is that the PP has a larger NMDA/AMPA charge ratio. This difference could be observed under many conditions, including block of all voltage-dependent conductances and elimination of the negative resistance of NMDA channels by removing extracellular Mg2+. The difference in ratio thus cannot be attributed to regenerative currents. The higher NMDA component of the distal PP synapses could help to make these synapses more powerful under depolarizing conditions.},

The convincing evidence for the presence of non-reporting biases should be of great concern to review authors. Regardless of whether an entire study report or a particular study result is unavailable selectively, the same consequence can arise: risk of bias in a synthesis because available results differ systematically from missing results. The chapter discusses two means of reducing, or potentially avoiding, bias due to missing results. It also describes a framework for assessing the risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis. This consolidates and extends existing guidance: a key feature is that review authors are prompted to consider whether a synthesis (e.g. meta-analysis) is missing any eligible results and, if so, whether the summary estimate can be trusted given the missing results.},

  abstract = {A P value, or the magnitude or direction of results can influence decisions about whether, when, and how research findings are disseminated. Regardless of whether an entire study or a particular study result is unavailable because investigators considered the results to be unfavorable, bias in a meta-analysis may occur when available results differ systematically from missing results. In this article, we summarize the empirical evidence for various reporting biases that lead to study results being unavailable for inclusion in systematic reviews, with a focus on health research. These biases include publication bias and selective nonreporting bias. We describe processes that systematic reviewers can use to minimize the risk of bias due to missing results in meta-analyses of health research, such as comprehensive searches and prospective approaches to meta-analysis. We also outline methods that have been designed for assessing risk of bias due to missing results in meta-analyses of health research, including using tools to assess selective nonreporting of results, ascertaining qualitative signals that suggest not all studies were identified, and generating funnel plots to identify small-study effects, one cause of which is reporting bias. Highlights Bias in a meta-analysis may occur when available results differ systematically from missing results. Several different tools, plots, and statistical methods have been designed for assessing risk of bias due to missing results in meta-analyses. These include comparison of prespecified analysis plans with completed reports to detect selective nonreporting of results, consideration of qualitative signals that suggest not all studies were identified, and the use of funnel plots to identify small-study effects, for which reporting bias is one of several causes. Information from approaches such as funnel plots and selection models is more difficult to interpret than from less subjective approaches such as detection of incompletely reported results in studies for which prespecified analysis plans were available.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA1 synapses has been extensively studied, but the mechanisms responsible for its expression remain unresolved. We tested a hypothesis that there are multiple, developmentally regulated expression mechanisms by directly comparing LTP in hippocampal slices obtained from rats of two ages. At postnatal day 12 (P12), LTP was fully accounted for by an increase in potency (mean amplitude of responses excluding failures). This was associated with either an increase in AMPA receptor single-channel conductance (γ) or no change in γ, suggesting an increase in the number of AMPA receptors. At P6, LTP was explained by an additional two mechanisms. In the majority of neurons, LTP was associated with an increase in success rate and a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation. In the remaining neurons, LTP was attributable to an increase in potency. However, in contrast to P12 neurons, the potency increase was associated with a decrease in γ, suggesting the insertion of receptors with lower γ. We conclude that there are multiple expression mechanisms for LTP at CA1 synapses that are developmentally regulated. These findings suggest that a single class of synapse uses a number of different molecular mechanisms to produce long-term changes in synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {The calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a dodecameric holoenzyme important for encoding memory. Its activation, triggered by binding of calcium-calmodulin, persists autonomously after calmodulin dissociation. One (receiver) kinase captures and subsequently phosphorylates the regulatory domain peptide of a donor kinase forming a chained dimer as the first stage of autonomous activation. Protein dynamics simulations examined the conformational changes triggered by dimer formation and phosphorylation, aimed to provide a molecular rationale for human mutations that result in learning disabilities. Ensembles generated from X-ray crystal structures were characterized by network centrality and community analysis. Mutual information related collective motions to local fragment dynamics encoded with a structural alphabet. Implicit solvent tCONCOORD conformational ensembles revealed the dynamic architecture of inactive kinase domains was co-opted in the activated dimer but the network hub shifted from the nucleotide binding cleft to the captured peptide. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) showed nucleotide and substrate binding determinants formed coupled nodes in long-range signal relays between regulatory peptides in the dimer. Strain in the extended captured peptide was balanced by reduced flexibility of the receiver kinase C-lobe core. The relays were organized around a hydrophobic patch between the captured peptide and a key binding helix. The human mutations aligned along the relays. Thus, these mutations could disrupt the allosteric network alternatively, or in addition, to altered binding affinities. Non-binding protein sectors distant from the binding sites mediated the allosteric signalling; providing possible targets for inhibitor design. Phosphorylation of the peptide modulated the dielectric of its binding pocket to strengthen the patch, non-binding sectors, domain interface and temporal correlations between parallel relays. These results provide the molecular details underlying the reported positive kinase cooperativity to enrich the discussion on how autonomous activation by phosphorylation leads to long-term behavioural effects., Protein kinases play central roles in intracellular signalling. Auto-phosphorylation by bound nucleotide typically precedes phosphate transfer to multiple substrates. Protein conformational changes are central to kinase function, altering binding affinities to change cellular location and shunt from one signal pathway to another. In the brain, the multi-subunit kinase, CaMKII is activated by calcium-calmodulin upon calcium jumps produced by synaptic stimulation. Auto-transphosphorylation of a regulatory peptide enables the kinase to remain activated and mediate long-term behavioural effects after return to basal calcium levels. A database of mutated residues responsible for these effects is difficult to reconcile solely with impaired nucleotide or substrate binding. Therefore, we have computationally generated interaction networks to map the conformational plasticity of the kinase domains where most mutations localize. The network generated from the atomic structure of a phosphorylated dimer resolves protein sectors based on their collective motions. The sectors link nucleotide and substrate binding sites in self-reinforcing relays between regulatory peptides. The self-reinforcement is strengthened by phosphorylation consistent with the reported positive cooperativity of kinase activity with calcium-calmodulin concentration. The network gives a better match with the mutations and, in addition, reveals target sites for drug development.},

Do they generate an ‘iron cage’ effect, imposing a passive and uniform conformity on global standards? The paper examines the organization of higher education and research set-ups with a strong lens. What does academic quality actually mean when observed in the field? How do universities and their subunits – professional schools, colleges, etc. – actually achieve what they call quality? A methodological and analytical framework is tested. Three sociological concepts – diversity, recognition and local order – make it possible to build four ideal types applicable to comparative inquiry. Such a typology identifies the interdependencies existing between how they position themselves with respect to quality dimensions and internal organizational measures. The paper contributes to a broader organizational study agenda: how do local orders face and deal with market and hierarchy dynamics in a global world of apparently increasing standardization under pressure from soft power. It questions the effect of the ‘iron cage’ hypothesis. It lists a series of changing patterns or dynamics between types of universities in terms of quality sensitivity, fabrication and content.

This review examines current insights into mechanisms of AMPAR and NMDAR localization by PSD‐95 and their spatial distribution at postsynaptic sites to illuminate the structural and functional framework of postsynaptic signaling. It subsequently delineates how β2 adrenergic receptor (β2 AR) signaling via adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP‐dependent protein kinase PKA is organized within nanodomains. Here, we discuss targeting of β2 AR, adenylyl cyclase, and PKA to defined signaling complexes at postsynaptic sites, i.e., AMPARs and the L‐type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2, and other subcellular surface localizations, the role of A~kinase anchor proteins, the physiological relevance of the spatial restriction of corresponding signaling, and their interplay with signal transduction by the Ca2+‐ and calmodulin‐dependent kinase CaMKII. How localized and specific signaling by cAMP occurs is a central cellular question. The dendritic spine constitutes an ideal paradigm for elucidating the dimensions of spatially restricted signaling because of their small size and defined protein composition.},

It is a building block for transparent and cumulative science because it enables the originator and other researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results came about, while avoiding a variety of errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical and computational results. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code, PAC). PAC eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several more advantages. Making technical advancements that serve reproducibility more widely accessible for researchers holds the potential to innovate the research process and to help it become more productive, credible, and reliable.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The cardiac field has benefited from the availability of several CaMKII inhibitors serving as research tools to test putative CaMKII pathways associated with cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. Successful demonstrations of its critical pathophysiological roles have elevated CaMKII as a key target in heart failure, arrhythmia, and other forms of heart disease. This has caught the attention of the pharmaceutical industry, which is now racing to develop CaMKII inhibitors as safe and effective therapeutic agents. While the first generation of CaMKII inhibitor development is focused on blocking its activity based on ATP binding to its catalytic site, future inhibitors can also target sites affecting its regulation by Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/CaM or translocation to some of its protein substrates. The recent availability of crystal structures of the kinase in the autoinhibited and activated state, and of the dodecameric holoenzyme, provides insights into the mechanism of action of existing inhibitors. It is also accelerating the design and development of better pharmacological inhibitors. This review examines the structure of the kinase and suggests possible sites for its inhibition. It also analyzes the uses and limitations of current research tools. Development of new inhibitors will enable preclinical proof of concept tests and clinical development of successful lead compounds, as well as improved research tools to more accurately examine and extend knowledge of the role of CaMKII in cardiac health and disease.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {1. Whole-cell tight-seal recordings were obtained from visually identified pyramidal cells (PCs) and interneurones (INs) in the CA1 field of thin hippocampal slices from 13- to 23-day-old rats. The INs sampled were classified according to their location either in the molecular layer (M-INs) or in the oriens layer and alveus (OA-INs). PCs and INs differed in their mode of firing when depolarized by a prolonged current pulse. Whereas PCs fired a single action potential, most INs responded with non-accommodating high frequency spike firing. 2. In the presence of 1 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX), bath application of either 50 microM L-glutamate with 10 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or 2.5 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), induced a similar conductance increase in PCs and INs that was completely blocked by 200 microM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). The NMDA receptor-mediated currents reversed around 4 mV and exhibited an area of negative slope conductance at potentials more negative than -20 to -30 mV in the presence of 1-2 mM Mg2+. 3. Dual-component excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked in PCs and INs by stimulating afferent fibres close to the neurone. The NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSCs (NMDA EPSC) was isolated by adding 10 microM CNQX to block non-NMDA receptors. The NMDA EPSCs in all cell types reversed around 1.5 mV and were abolished by 50 microM APV. 4. In saline containing 1 mM Mg2+, the peak current-voltage (I-V) relationship of NMDA EPSCs in PCs and INs showed an area of negative slope conductance at voltages more negative than -20 to -30 mV. In nominally Mg(2+)-free saline, the peak I-V relation was linear over a much wider voltage range in both cell types. 5. The 10-90\% rise times of NMDA EPSCs at -60 mV ranged from 4.5 to 16 ms in PCs (mean 8.7 ms; n = 25) and in M-INs (mean 9.1 ms; n = 10). Their decay could be best fitted with the sum of two exponentials. The decay of NMDA EPSCs in PCs was significantly slower than that recorded in INs. The average fast (tau f) and slow (tau s) time constants of decay were, respectively, 66.5 and 353.9 ms in PCs, and 34.4 and 212.5 ms in M-INs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) accounts for up to 2 percent of all brain protein and is essential to memory function. CaMKII activity is known to regulate dynamic shifts in the size and signaling strength of neuronal connections, a process known as synaptic plasticity. Increasingly, computational models are used to explore synaptic plasticity and the mechanisms regulating CaMKII activity. Conventional modeling approaches may exclude biophysical detail due to the impractical number of state combinations that arise when explicitly monitoring the conformational changes, ligand binding, and phosphorylation events that occur on each of the CaMKII holoenzyme’s twelve subunits. To manage the combinatorial explosion without necessitating bias or loss in biological accuracy, we use a specialized syntax in the software MCell to create a rule-based model of the twelve-subunit CaMKII holoenzyme. Here we validate the rule-based model against previous measures of CaMKII activity and investigate molecular mechanisms of CaMKII regulation. Specifically, we explore how Ca2+/CaM-binding may both stabilize CaMKII subunit activation and regulate maintenance of CaMKII autophosphorylation. Noting that Ca2+/CaM and protein phosphatases bind CaMKII at nearby or overlapping sites, we compare model scenarios in which Ca2+/CaM and protein phosphatase do or do not structurally exclude each other’s binding to CaMKII. Our results suggest a functional mechanism for the so-called “CaM trapping” phenomenon, such that Ca2+/CaM structurally excludes phosphatase binding and thereby prolongs CaMKII autophosphorylation. We conclude that structural protection of autophosphorylated CaMKII by Ca2+/CaM may be an important mechanism for regulation of synaptic plasticity. Author summary In the hippocampus, the dynamic fluctuation in size and strength of neuronal connections is thought to underlie learning and memory processes. These fluctuations, called synaptic plasticity, are in-part regulated by the protein calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). During synaptic plasticity, CaMKII becomes activated in the presence of calcium ions (Ca2+) and calmodulin (CaM), allowing it to interact enzymatically with downstream binding partners. Interestingly, activated CaMKII can phosphorylate itself, resulting in state changes that allow CaMKII to be functionally active independent of Ca2+/CaM. Phosphorylation of CaMKII at Thr-286/287 has been shown to be a critical component of learning and memory. To explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of CaMKII holoenzymes, we use a rule-based approach that reduces computational complexity normally associated with representing the wide variety of functional states that a CaMKII holoenzyme can adopt. Using this approach we observe regulatory mechanisms that might be obscured by reductive approaches. Our results newly suggest that CaMKII phosphorylation at Thr-286/287 is stabilized by a mechanism in which CaM structurally excludes phosphatase binding at that site.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a key mediator of long-term potentiation (LTP). Whereas acute intracellular injection of catalytically active CaMKII fragments saturates LTP (Lledo et al., 1995), an autonomously active form (T286D) of CaMKII holoenzyme expressed in transgenic mice did not saturate potentiation (Mayford et al., 1995). To better understand the role of the holoenzyme in the control of synaptic strength, we transfected hippocampal neurons with constructs encoding forms of CaMKII mimicking different phosphorylation states. Surprisingly, T286D not only failed to potentiate synaptic strength, but produced synaptic depression through an long-term depression (LTD)-like process. T305/T306 phosphorylation was critical for this depression because overexpression of the pseudophosphorylated form (T286D/T305D/T306D) caused depression that occluded LTD, and overexpression of an autonomous form in which T305/T306 could not be phosphorylated (T286D/T305A/T306A) prevented LTD (instead producing potentiation). Therefore, autonomous CaMKII can lead to either LTP or LTD, depending on the phosphorylation state of the control point, T305/T306.},

The test configuration is an ODEs based model that simulates a biogas production reactor. The research shows that most of the tested solvers pass the accuracy-test (the difference didn’t exceed 0,07\%), however only selected are efficient. Most of Runge-Kutta based methods are slow and require an enormous number of steps (more than 2.5~×~108). Only multi-step implicit methods are long term solutions - they provide great accuracy while dealing well with stiff, non-smooth ODEs sets. The best from tested solutions were two MATLAB solvers - ode23s and ode15s, as well as a python solver - the LSODA. The first needed averagely 84,051s of calculation time, and 96465 steps, while ode15s required just 11,529s, performing over 20-times fewer steps. The LSODA is ranked somewhere between them with 18,806s of calculation time and the total number of 23730 steps for tested ODEs set.},

Indeed, a hallmark of a “pure” case of anterograde amnesia is the inability to encode (or learn) new information, despite relatively intact abilities to retrieve premorbid memories, to remember a small amount of information, such as a phone number, for tens of seconds or even longer, and to demonstrate the improvements that accompany repeated performance of routine behaviors or repeated exposure to stimuli. Also spared in anterograde amnesia is every other major domain of cognition–sensory perception, language comprehension and production, motor control, intelligence, and so on. Because this condition produces so circumscribed a deficit of cognition, it provides an interesting case with which to examine the relation of consciousness to memory versus other domains of cognition. The analysis in this chapter will begin with a review of the neurological exam and its implications, followed by the anatomical and physiological profile of the amnesic brain, followed by considerations of cognitive effects of damage to the MTL. It will end with a consideration of phenomenology.},

  abstract = {Much animal research into potential treatments for humans is wasted because it is poorly conducted and not evaluated through systematic reviews  Clinicians and the public often consider it axiomatic that animal research has contributed to the treatment of human disease, yet little evidence is available to support this view. Few methods exist for evaluating the clinical relevance or importance of basic animal research, and so its clinical (as distinct from scientific) contribution remains uncertain.1 Anecdotal evidence or unsupported claims are often used as justification—for example, statements that the need for animal research is “self evident”2 or that “Animal experimentation is a valuable research method which has proved itself over time.”3 Such statements are an inadequate form of evidence for such a controversial area of research. We argue that systematic reviews of existing and future research are needed. Despite the lack of systematic evidence for its effectiveness, basic animal research in the United Kingdom receives much more funding than clinical research.1 4 5 Given this, and because the public accepts animal research only on the assumption that it benefits humans,6 the clinical relevance of animal experiments needs urgent clarification. Several methods are available to evaluate animal research. These include historical analysis,7 critiques of animal models,8 investigations into the development of treatments,5 surveys of clinicians' views,9 and citation analyses.10 However, perhaps the best way of producing evidence about the value of animal research is to conduct systematic reviews of animal studies and, where possible, compare the results of these with the results of the corresponding clinical trials. So what do studies that have done this show? We searched Medline to identify published systematic reviews of animal experiments (see bmj.com for the search strategy).

These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are Hebbian input-specific mechanisms that rapidly increase or decrease AMPAR synaptic strength at specific inputs, and homeostatic plasticity that globally scales-up or -down AMPAR synaptic strength across many or even all inputs. Frequently, these changes in synaptic strength are also accompanied by a change in the subunit composition of AMPARs at the synapse due to the trafficking to and from the synapse of receptors lacking GluA2 subunits. These GluA2-lacking receptors are most often GluA1 homomeric receptors that exhibit higher single-channel conductance and are Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-permeable (CP-AMPAR). This review article will focus on the role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of GluA1 CP-AMPAR recruitment and removal from hippocampal synapses during synaptic plasticity with an emphasis on the crucial role of local signaling by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the Ca\textsuperscript{2+}calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) that is coordinated by the postsynaptic scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this report, we investigate the molecular mechanism for this phenomenon by comparing the rate of dissociation of a novel fluorescently labeled CaM from two synthetic peptides and from the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of a recombinant preparation of CaM-kinase. Dissociation of a complex of CaM and CKII(296-312), a peptide representing close to the minimum CaM-binding domain of the α subunit of CaM-kinase, exhibited a fast off-rate of 5.0 s\textsuperscript{−1}. This was similar to the off-rate of 1.1 s\textsuperscript{−1} for the dissociation of CaM from the nonphosphorylated form of CaM-kinase. In contrast, dissociation of CaM from either autophosphorylated CaM-kinase or peptide CKII(290-314) was extremely slow with apparent off-rates of about 3-9 × 10\textsuperscript{−5} s\textsuperscript{−1}. Along with information from the crystal structure of Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/CaM bound to CKII(290-314) (Meador, W. E., Means, A. R., and Quiocho, F. A. (1993) \emph{Science} 262, 1718-1721), our results suggest a model in which CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase induces a conformational change in the region of the CaM-binding domain which allows the formation of additional stabilizing interactions with CaM. We predict that this involves amino acids 293-298 in CaM-kinase. The possible consequences of these observations on the reversibility of CaM trapping in native CaM-kinase are discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {There has been considerable controversy about pre- versus postsynaptic expression of memory-related long-term potentiation (LTP), with corresponding disputes about underlying mechanisms. We report here an instance in male mice, in which both types of potentiation are expressed but in separate branches of the same hippocampal afferent. Induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus (DG) branch of the lateral perforant path (LPP) reduces paired-pulse facilitation, is blocked by antagonism of cannabinoid receptor type 1, and is not affected by suppression of postsynaptic actin polymerization. These observations are consistent with presynaptic expression. The opposite pattern of results was obtained in the LPP branch that innervates the distal dendrites of CA3: LTP did not reduce paired-pulse facilitation, was unaffected by the cannabinoid receptor blocker, and required postsynaptic actin filament assembly. Differences in the two LPP termination sites were also noted for frequency facilitation of synaptic responses, an effect that was reproduced in a two-step simulation by small adjustments to vesicle release dynamics. These results indicate that different types of glutamatergic neurons impose different forms of filtering and synaptic plasticity on their afferents. They also suggest that inputs are routed to, and encoded by, different sites within the hippocampus depending upon the pattern of activity arriving over the parent axon.},

We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.},

This is thought to require plastic changes in the strength of specific synaptic contacts.Dentate gyrus cells provide sparse but powerful synaptic mossy fibre connections to CA3 pyramidal cells, which display a large dynamic range of presynaptic plasticity. This repertoire was recently extended to include postsynaptic plasticity of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), making these synapses competent for conventional long-term potentiation of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs.Local recurrent connectivity gives rise to the CA3 autoassociative network amenable to spike-timing dependent plasticity, which can be facilitated by heterosynaptic interactions.Local GABAergic loops control spike transfer at CA3 connections. GABAergic connectivity is subject to prominent structural and molecular plasticity in relation to memory encoding.Mice impaired in the plasticity of CA3–CA3 or dentate gyrus–CA3 connections show deficits in one-trial memory tasks. Nevertheless, a direct link between memory and functional plasticity of specific excitatory or inhibitory connections is still awaited.},

  abstract = {Structural and biophysical studies reveal how CaMKII kinases, which are important for cellular learning and memory, are switched on by binding of Ca2+/calmodulin., CaMKII enzymes transmit calcium ion (Ca2+) signals released inside the cell by regulating signal transduction pathways through phosphorylation: Ca2+ first binds to the small regulatory protein CaM; this Ca2+/CaM complex then binds to and activates the kinase, which phosphorylates other proteins in the cell. Since CaMKs remain active long after rapid Ca2+ pulses have dropped they function as molecular switches that turn on or off crucial cell functions in response to Ca2+ levels. The multifunctional CaMKII forms of this enzyme – of which there are four in human – are important in many processes including signaling in neurons and controlling of the heart rate. They are particularly abundant in the brain where they probably play a role in memory. CaMKII forms an exceptionally large, dodecameric complex. Here, we describe the crystal structure of this complex for each of the four human CaMKII catalytic domains in their autoinhibited states, a complex of CaMKII with Ca2+/CaM, as well as the structure of the oligomerization domain (the part of the protein that mediates complex formation) in its physiological dodecameric state and in a tetradecameric state. Detailed comparison of this large body of structural data together with biophysical studies has allowed us to better understand the structural mechanisms of CaMKII activation by CaM and to explain many of the complex regulatory features of these essential enzymes.},

  abstract = {Our review focuses on the mechanisms which enable the late maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP; {$>$}3h), a phenomenon which is thought to underlie prolonged memory. About 20years ago we showed for the first time that the maintenance of LTP – like memory storage – depends on intact protein synthesis and thus, consists of at least two temporal phases. Here we concentrate on mechanisms required for the induction of the transient early-LTP and of the protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP. Our group has shown that the induction of late-LTP requires the associative activation of heterosynaptic inputs, i.e. the synergistic activation of glutamatergic and modulatory, reinforcing inputs within specific, effective time windows. The induction of late-LTP is characterized by novel, late-associative properties such as ‘synaptic tagging’ and ‘late-associative reinforcement’. Both phenomena require the associative setting of synaptic tags as well as the availability of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) and they are restricted to functional dendritic compartments, in general. ‘Synaptic tagging’ guarantees input specificity and thus the specific processing of afferent signals for the establishment of late-LTP. ‘Late-associative reinforcement’ describes a process where early-LTP by the co-activation of modulatory inputs can be transformed into late-LTP in activated synapses where a tag is set. Recent evidence from behavioral experiments, which studied processes of emotional and cognitive reinforcement of LTP, point to the physiological relevance of the above mechanisms during cellular and system's memory formation.},

  abstract = {How many times should a simulation be run to generate valid predictions? With a deterministic simulation, the answer simply is just once. With a stochastic simulation, the answer is more complex. Different researchers have proposed and used different heuristics. A review of the models presented at a conference on cognitive modeling illustrates the range of solutions and problems in this area. We present the argument that because the simulation is a theory, not data, it should not so much be sampled but run enough times to provide stable predictions of performance and the variance of performance. This applies to both pure simulations as well as human-in-the-loop simulations. We demonstrate the importance of running the simulation until it has stable performance as defined by the effect size of interest. When runs are expensive we suggest a minimum number of runs based on power calculations; when runs are inexpensive we suggest a maximum necessary number of runs. We also suggest how to adjust the number of runs for different effect sizes of interest.},

The reuse of simulation models is especially appealing, based on the intuitive argument that it should reduce the time and cost for model development. In a discussion with four simulation modelling experts, however, a number of issues were raised that mean these benefits may not be obtainable. These issues include the motivation to develop reusable models, the validity and credibility of models to be reused, and the cost and time for familiarisation. An alternative simulation methodology was proposed, that may lend itself better to model reuse.},

The crystal structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of CaMKII, determined at 1.8 A resolution, reveals an unexpected dimeric organization in which the calmodulin-responsive regulatory segments form a coiled-coil strut that blocks peptide and ATP binding to the otherwise intrinsically active kinase domains. A threonine residue in the regulatory segment, which when phosphorylated renders CaMKII calmodulin independent, is held apart from the catalytic sites by the organization of the dimer. This ensures a strict Ca2+ dependence for initial activation. The structure of the kinase dimer, when combined with small-angle X-ray scattering data for the holoenzyme, suggests that inactive CaMKII forms tightly packed autoinhibited assemblies that convert upon activation into clusters of loosely tethered and independent kinase domains.},

This review also explores the possibility that identifying and characterising the molecular interactions responsible for the molecular targeting of CaMKII in different cells in vivo, and identifying the sites on CaMKII and/or the binding proteins through which these interactions occur, could lead to the development of highly selective inhibitors of specific CaMKII-mediated functional responses in specific cells that would not affect CaMKII-mediated responses in other cells.

  abstract = {The block of NMDA receptor channels by external magnesium (Mg2+) is believed to be of great physiological importance. The original model of a Mg2+ binding site deep inside the pore, near the cytoplasmic side of the channel has, however, become more and more questionable. In the experiments reported here, Mg2+ block was studied in inside-out patches and inside-out giant patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant NR1/NR2A receptors. The conductance of single NR1/NR2A receptor channels was rather weakly dependent on the concentration of permeant ions, and if only internal permeant ion concentration was changed the voltage for half-maximal block by Mg2+ shifted with the reversal potential. This suggests that NMDA receptor channels are strongly negatively charged. The charged spider venom Argiotoxin 636 (ATX) exhibited both external and internal block of NR1/NR2A receptors, with apparent electrical distances of almost 100\% from both sides of the channel. This gives strong evidence against a considerable asymmetry of the channel. The electrical distance and voltage for half maximal block by Mg2+ was dependent on the monovalent ion species, especially on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This effect was independent of the reversal potential, suggesting a direct interaction between Mg2+ and other ions in the channel. A model is presented which explains the excessive voltage-dependence for block by Mg2+ and ATX by the interaction of monovalent ions with the blocking ion.},

  abstract = {How memories persist is a fundamental neurobiological question. The most commonly studied physiological model of memory is long-term potentiation (LTP). The molecular mechanisms of LTP can be divided into two phases: induction, triggering the potentiation; and maintenance, sustaining the potentiation over time. Although many molecules participate in induction, very few have been implicated in the mechanism of maintenance. Understanding maintenance, however, is critical for testing the hypothesis that LTP sustains memory storage in the brain. Only a single molecule has been found both necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP — the brain-specific, atypical PKC isoform, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMζ). Although full-length PKC isoforms respond to transient second messengers, and are involved in LTP induction, PKMζ is a second messenger-independent kinase, consisting of the independent catalytic domain of PKCζ, and is persistently active to sustain LTP maintenance. PKMζ is produced by a unique PKMζ mRNA, which is generated by an internal promoter within the PKCζ gene and transported to the dendrites of neurons. LTP induction increases new PKMζ synthesis, and the increased level of PKMζ then enhances synaptic transmission by doubling the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPAR) through GluR2 subunit-mediated trafficking of the receptors to the synapse. PKMζ mediates synaptic potentiation specifically during the late-phase of LTP, as PKMζ inhibitors can reverse established LTP when applied several hours after tetanization in hippocampal slices or 1 day after tetanization in vivo. These studies set the stage for testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of LTP maintenance sustains memory storage. PKMζ inhibition in the hippocampus after learning eliminates the retention of spatial memory. Once the PKMζ inhibitor has been eliminated, the memory is still erased, but new spatial memories can be learned and stored. Similar results are found for conditioned taste aversion when the inhibitor is injected in the insular neocortex. Thus PKMζ is the first molecule found to be a component of the long-term memory trace.},

This activation is required for LTP induction, but the role of the kinase in the maintenance of LTP is less clear. Elucidating the mechanisms of maintenance may provide insights into the molecular processes that underlie the stability of stored memories. In this brief review, we will outline the criteria for evaluating an LTP maintenance mechanism. The specific hypothesis evaluated is that LTP is maintained by the complex of activated CaMKII with the NMDAR. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is substantial, but further experiments are required, notably to determine the time course and persistence of complex after LTP induction. Additional work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. It has been proposed by Frey and Morris that late LTP involves the setting of a molecular tag during LTP induction, which subsequently allows the activated synapse to capture the proteins responsible for late LTP. However, the molecular processes by which this leads to the structural growth that underlies late LTP are completely unclear. Based on known binding reactions, we suggest the first molecularly specific version of tag/capture hypothesis: that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, once formed, serves as a tag, which then leads to a binding cascade involving densin, delta-catenin, and N-cadherin (some of which are newly synthesized). Delta-catenin binds AMPA-binding protein (ABP), leading to the LTP-induced increase in AMPA channel content. The addition of postsynaptic N-cadherin, and the complementary increase on the presynaptic side, leads to a trans-synaptically coordinated increase in synapse size (and more release sites). It is suggested that synaptic strength is stored stably through the combined actions of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex and N-cadherin dimers. These N-cadherin pairs have redundant storage that could provide informational stability in a manner analogous to the base-pairing in DNA.},

However, the molecular processes by which this leads to the structural growth that underlies late LTP are completely unclear. Based on known binding reactions, we suggest the first molecularly specific version of tag/capture hypothesis: that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, once formed, serves as a tag, which then leads to a binding cascade involving densin, delta-catenin, and N-cadherin (some of which are newly synthesized). Delta-catenin binds AMPA-binding protein (ABP), leading to the LTP-induced increase in AMPA channel content. The addition of postsynaptic N-cadherin, and the complementary increase on the presynaptic side, leads to a trans-synaptically coordinated increase in synapse size (and more release sites). It is suggested that synaptic strength is stored stably through the combined actions of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex and N-cadherin dimers. These N-cadherin pairs have redundant storage that could provide informational stability in a manner analogous to the base-pairing in DNA.},

Drugs that antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor activity, which is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) at various hippocampal synapses2–4, block LTP and impair water-maze learning4–6. This has led to the hypothesis that NMDA receptors, through their involvement in LTP, may be necessary for spatial4–11 and other forms of learning12,13. We examined this hypothesis using NPC17742 (2R,4R,5S-2-amino-4,5-(l,2-cyclo hexyl)-7-phosphonoheptano acid), a potent and specific antagonist of NMDA receptors14–17. Here we report that NPC17742 completely blocked dentate gyrus LTP but did not prevent normal spatial learning in rats that had been made familiar with the general task requirements by non-spatial pretraining. Although these results do not rule out a contribution of NMDA-mediated dentate LTP to spatial learning, they indicate that this form of LTP is not required for normal spatial learning in the watermaze.},

A changed landscape is emerging, which offers academics new ways of working in research and new kinds of academic output for them to use in their teaching. Two areas are considered: the conduct of research (in particular the range of activities associated with publication and dissemination of research findings) and the conduct of teaching. The links between these practices are explored in terms of a revised view of scholarship, the perspective of digital scholarship. The paper begins with a review of literature and draws on an interview study to illustrate changes in academic practice, both for teaching and research. The study of 22 academics with expertise in educational technology provides a commentary on the changes, identifying open access as important in both teaching and publication.

  abstract = {Summary: Rule-based modeling is invaluable when the number of possible species and reactions in a model become too large to allow convenient manual specification. The popular rule-based software tools BioNetGen and NFSim provide powerful modeling and simulation capabilities at the cost of learning a complex scripting language which is used to specify these models. Here, we introduce a modeling tool that combines new graphical rule-based model specification with existing simulation engines in a seamless way within the familiar Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling environment. A mathematical model can be built integrating explicit reaction networks with reaction rules. In addition to offering a large choice of ODE and stochastic solvers, a model can be simulated using a network free approach through the NFSim simulation engine.Availability and implementation: Available as VCell (versions 6.0 and later) at the Virtual Cell web site (http://vcell.org/). The application installs and runs on all major platforms and does not require registration for use on the user’s computer.

  abstract = {Glutamate receptors are the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, responsible for mediating the vast majority of excitatory transmission in neuronal networks. The AMPA- and NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the fast synaptic responses, while metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are coupled to downstream signaling cascades that act on much slower timescales. These functionally distinct receptor sub-types are co-expressed at individual synapses, allowing for the precise temporal modulation of postsynaptic excitability and plasticity. Intriguingly, these receptors are differentially distributed with respect to the presynaptic release site. While iGluRs are enriched in the core of the synapse directly opposing the release site, mGluRs reside preferentially at the border of the synapse. As such, to understand the differential contribution of these receptors to synaptic transmission, it is important to not only consider their signaling properties, but also the mechanisms that control the spatial segregation of these receptor types within synapses. In this review, we will focus on the mechanisms that control the organization of glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane with respect to the release site, and discuss how this organization could regulate synapse physiology.},

  abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Disrupted cortico-striatal transmission is an early event that contributes to neuronal spine and synapse dysfunction primarily in striatal medium spiny neurons, the most vulnerable cell type in the disease, but also in neurons of other brain regions including the cortex. Although striatal and cortical neurons eventually degenerate, these synaptic and circuit changes may underlie some of the earliest motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, synaptic dysfunction and spine loss are hypothesized to be therapeutically reversible before neuronal death occurs, and restoration of normal synaptic function may delay neurodegeneration. One of the earliest synaptic alterations to occur in HD mouse models is enhanced striatal extrasynaptic NMDA receptor expression and activity. This activity is mediated primarily through GluN2B subunit-containing receptors and is associated with increased activation of cell death pathways, inhibition of survival signaling, and greater susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a pro-apoptotic kinase highly expressed in neurons during development. In the adult brain, DAPK1 becomes re-activated and recruited to extrasynaptic NMDAR complexes during neuronal death, where it phosphorylates GluN2B at S1303, amplifying toxic receptor function. Approaches to reduce DAPK1 activity have demonstrated benefit in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic stress, indicating that DAPK1 may be a novel target for neuroprotection. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of DAPK1 occurs early in the YAC128 HD mouse model, and contributes to elevated extrasynaptic GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation. Inhibition of DAPK1 normalizes extrasynaptic GluN2B phosphorylation and surface expression, and completely prevents YAC128 striatal spine loss in cortico-striatal co-culture, thus validating DAPK1 as a potential target for synaptic protection in HD and warranting further development of DAPK1-targeted therapies for neurodegeneration.},

The question is: how reliable are scientific results that are reported as statistically significant, and how does this reliability develop over time? Based on 35,515 papers in psychology published between 1975 and 2017 containing 487,996 test values, this article empirically examines the statistical power, publication bias, and p-hacking, as well as the false discovery rate. Assuming constant true effects, the statistical power was found to be lower than the suggested 80\% except for large underlying true effects (d = 0.8) and increased only slightly over time. Also, publication bias and p-hacking were found to be substantial. The share of false discoveries among all significant results was estimated at 17.7\%, assuming a proportion θ = 50\% of all hypotheses being true and assuming that p-hacking is the only mechanism generating a higher proportion of just significant results compared to just nonsignificant results. As the analyses rely on multiple assumptions that cannot be tested, alternative scenarios were laid out, again resulting in the rather optimistic result that although research results may suffer from low statistical power and publication selection bias, most of the results reported as statistically significant may contain substantial results, rather than statistical artifacts.},

  abstract = {The fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is mediated by L-glutamate, which activates cation-selective receptor channels located in postsynaptic membranes. Physiological and biophysical studies indicate the existence of different glutamate receptor channels with distinct gating kinetics, ion permeabilities, and conductances. The main channel classes based on distinct pharmacological properties are termed N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. The CNS expression characteristics of NR2 subunits described in this chapter suggest a complex genetic control determining which central neurons carry which NMDA receptor subtypes. A study of recombinantly expressed NMDA receptors described in this chapter indicated significant differences in the properties of four NR1-NR2 receptors. An important function of NMDA channels is to detect synchronicity in pre- and postsynaptic depolarization events. The changes in the kinetic properties of NMDA receptor channels are present in layer IV neurons of the developing rat visual cortex. In these neurons, NMDA-receptor mediated postsynaptic currents decay with double exponential time courses. During development, the contribution of the slower component progressively decreased. The slow component persisted in dark-reared animals, indicating long-term modifications of native NMDA-receptor gating properties, which depend on the electrical activity of these neurons. The progressive increase in NR2A expression with a concomitant decline in NR2C or NR2D expression in cortical layers might underlie the observed modification in NMDA channel gating.},

Preprint servers decouple dissemination of research papers from their evaluation and certification by journals, allowing researchers to share work immediately, receive feedback from a much larger audience, and provide evidence of productivity long before formal publication. Launched in 2013 as a non-profit community service, the bioRxiv server has brought preprint practice to the life sciences and recently posted its 64,000th manuscript. The server now receives more than four million views per month and hosts papers spanning all areas of biology. Initially dominated by evolutionary biology, genetics/genomics and computational biology, bioRxiv has been increasingly populated by papers in neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, and many other fields. Changes in journal and funder policies that encourage preprint posting have helped drive adoption, as has the development of bioRxiv technologies that allow authors to transfer papers easily between the server and journals. A bioRxiv user survey found that 42\% of authors post their preprints prior to journal submission whereas 37\% post concurrently with journal submission. Authors are motivated by a desire to share work early; they value the feedback they receive, and very rarely experience any negative consequences of preprint posting. Rapid dissemination via bioRxiv is also encouraging new initiatives that experiment with the peer review process and the development of novel approaches to literature filtering and assessment.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal cells contribute to memory by rapidly encoding information about the perceptual and behavioral structure of experience. This paper describes two complementary experimental approaches that illustrate two important mechanisms that confer these properties to hippocampal cells: (1) Enduring spatial memory and stable place fields each depend upon synaptic plasticity mechanisms that normally rely on the same NMDA-receptor mediated metabolic events as long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, hippocampal cells “learn” to encode information about the perceptual and behavioral structure of experiences. (2) Hippocampal cells encode the structure of experience and respond in a manner inconsistent with a spatial representation. Place fields are distributed heterogeneously in space, their locations are determined by non-geometric information, the population of active cells can indicate more than one location in space, and hippocampal cells encode discriminative stimuli independent of their spatial location. To the extent that the hippocampus encodes a map, it is more simply described as a memory map than a spatial map. Rather than computing spatial locations, the space it encodes is better described as a life or a problem space that encodes the history of experience into the relational structure of episodes.

Although calcineurin has been found in the highest concentrations in brain, it has also been detected in many other mammalian tissues. Well characterized in T cell activation by analysing the transcription factor NFAT, the function of calcineurin, however, was less well understood in other tissues and organs.

In postsynaptic densities (PSDs), CaMKII is required for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular process correlated with learning and memory. In response to Ca2+ elevation during hippocampal LTP induction, CaMKIIα, an isoform that translocates from the cytosol to PSDs, is activated through autophosphorylation at Thr286, generating autonomous kinase activity and a prolonged Ca2+/CaM-bound state. Moreover, PP1 inhibition enhances Thr286 autophosphorylation of CaMKIIα during LTP induction. By contrast, CaMKII nuclear import is regulated by Ser332 phosphorylation state. CaMKIIδ3, a nuclear isoform, is dephosphorylated at Ser332 by PP1, promoting its nuclear translocation, where it regulates transcription. In this review, we summarize physio-pathological roles of CaMKII/PP1 signaling in neurons. CaMKII and PP1 crosstalk and regulation of gene expression is important for neuronal plasticity as well as survival and/or differentiation.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) is operationally defined as a  long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy following high-frequency  stimulation of afferent fibers. Since the first full description of  the phenomenon in 1973, exploration of the mechanisms underlying  LTP induction has been one of the most active areas of research  in neuroscience. Of principal interest to those who study LTP,  particularly in the mammalian hippocampus, is its presumed role  in the establishment of stable memories, a role consistent with  “Hebbian” descriptions of memory formation. Other  characteristics of LTP, including its rapid induction, persistence,  and correlation with natural brain rhythms, provide circumstantial  support for this connection to memory storage. Nonetheless, there  is little empirical evidence that directly links LTP to the storage of  memories. In this target article we review a range of cellular and  behavioral characteristics of LTP and evaluate whether they are  consistent with the purported role of hippocampal LTP in memory  formation. We suggest that much of the present focus on LTP reflects  a preconception that LTP is a learning mechanism, although  the empirical evidence often suggests that LTP is unsuitable for such  a role. As an alternative to serving as a memory storage device, we  propose that LTP may serve as a neural equivalent to an arousal or  attention device in the brain. Accordingly, LTP may increase in a  nonspecific way the effective salience of discrete external stimuli  and may thereby facilitate the induction of memories at distant  synapses. Other hypotheses regarding the functional utility of this  intensely studied mechanism are conceivable; the intent of this target  article is not to promote a single hypothesis but rather to stimulate  discussion about the neural mechanisms underlying memory storage and  to appraise whether LTP can be considered a viable candidate for such  a mechanism.},

  abstract = {Molecular bistables are strong candidates for long-term information storage, for example, in synaptic plasticity. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) is a highly expressed synaptic protein which has been proposed to form a molecular bistable switch capable of maintaining its state for years despite protein turnover and stochastic noise. It has recently been shown that CaMKII holoenzymes exchange subunits among themselves. Here, we used computational methods to analyze the effect of subunit exchange on the CaMKII pathway in the presence of diffusion in two different micro-environments, the post synaptic density (PSD) and spine cytosol. We show that CaMKII exhibits multiple timescales of activity due to subunit exchange. Further, subunit exchange enhances information retention by CaMKII both by improving the stability of its switching in the PSD, and by slowing the decay of its activity in the spine cytosol. The existence of diverse timescales in the synapse has important theoretical implications for memory storage in networks., The brain stores memories by changing the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. Synapses that change their strength easily can quickly encode new information. But such synapses are also unstable. They tend to revert back to their original state and so struggle to retain information. By contrast, synapses that are slow to change their strength are slow to learn, but are good at remembering. The difference is a little like that between writing a message in wet sand versus carving it into stone. It is quick and easy to write on sand, but the resulting marks are temporary. Writing on stone is slow and difficult, but the results last far longer., The brain must strike a balance between how fast synapses can learn and how well they can retain that information. One molecule that helps with this is a synaptic protein called CaMKII. Each CaMKII molecule consists of multiple subunits and exists in either an active or inactive state. Experiments have shown that CaMKII molecules can swap subunits. But how does this affect memory?, Singh and Bhalla used a computer model to simulate subunit exchange between CaMKII molecules. The results revealed that when active CaMKII molecules swap subunits, synapses become better at retaining information. However, when inactive CaMKII molecules swap subunits, synapses do not become better at encoding information. Subunit exchange by CaMKII thus helps synapses stabilize existing memories, rather than form new ones. This makes it easier for the brain to retain stored information despite threats to stability such as the turnover of proteins., A better knowledge of how the brain balances quick learning and slow forgetting may help us to better understand brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (in which patients struggle to remember), and post-traumatic stress disorder (in which patients struggle to forget). Biological memory networks can also inspire artificial memory systems. Damaging a few components of a computer memory can erase all the stored information. By contrast, the brain loses many neurons every day without suffering the same catastrophic failure. Mimicking such fault tolerance in an artificial system would be highly valuable for storing critical memories.},

Here we present the first site-directed mutagenesis study on the dissociation of the high affinity complex between CaM and full-length CaM kinase II. We measured dissociation kinetics of CaM and CaM kinase II proteins by using a fluorescently modified CaM that is sensitive to binding to target proteins. In low [Ca(2+)], the phosphorylated mutant kinase F293A and the CaM mutant E120A/M124A exhibited deficient trapping compared with wild-type. In high [Ca(2+)], the CaM mutations E120A, M124A, and E120A/M124A and the CaM kinase II mutations F293A, F293E, N294A, N294P, and R297E increased dissociation rate constants by factors ranging from 2.3 to 116. We have also identified residues in CaM and CaM kinase II that interact in the trapped state by mutant cycle-based analysis, which suggests that interactions between Phe(293) in the kinase and Glu(120) and Met(124) in CaM specifically stabilize the trapped CaM-CaM kinase II complex. Our studies further show that Phe(293) and Asn(294) in CaM kinase II play dual roles, because they likely destabilize the low affinity state of CaM complexed to unphosphorylated kinase but stabilize the trapped state of CaM bound to phosphorylated kinase.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A fundamental neuroscience question is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or “tag” synapses as eligible for LTP. A likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Data also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKMζ synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I predicts that, for successful maintenance of LTP, either 1) PKMζ contributes to synaptic tagging, or 2) a low constitutive tag level persists during maintenance independent of PKMζ, or 3) maintenance of LTP is independent of tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKMζ activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However, we note data challenging the CaMKII feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activation of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to persistent elevation of PKMζ levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin. It also accounts for known properties of calmodulin that have been difficult to model so far, including the activity of nonsaturated forms of calmodulin (we predict the existence of open conformations in the absence of calcium), an increase in calcium affinity once calmodulin is bound to a target, and the differential activation of CaMKII and PP2B depending on calcium concentration.},

  abstract = {Multi-state modeling of biomolecules refers to a series of techniques used to represent and compute the behavior of biological molecules or complexes that can adopt a large number of possible functional states. Biological signaling systems often rely on complexes of biological macromolecules that can undergo several functionally significant modifications that are mutually compatible. Thus, they can exist in a very large number of functionally different states. Modeling such multi-state systems poses two problems: the problem of how to describe and specify a multi-state system (the "specification problem") and the problem of how to use a computer to simulate the progress of the system over time (the "computation problem"). To address the specification problem, modelers have in recent years moved away from explicit specification of all possible states and towards rule-based formalisms that allow for implicit model specification, including the κ-calculus, BioNetGen, the Allosteric Network Compiler, and others. To tackle the computation problem, they have turned to particle-based methods that have in many cases proved more computationally efficient than population-based methods based on ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, or the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm. Given current computing technology, particle-based methods are sometimes the only possible option. Particle-based simulators fall into two further categories: nonspatial simulators, such as StochSim, DYNSTOC, RuleMonkey, and the Network-Free Stochastic Simulator (NFSim), and spatial simulators, including Meredys, SRSim, and MCell. Modelers can thus choose from a variety of tools, the best choice depending on the particular problem. Development of faster and more powerful methods is ongoing, promising the ability to simulate ever more complex signaling processes in the future.},

However, a comprehensive overview of these p-hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p-hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p-hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p-hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p-hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p-hacking in practice.},

Well-timed bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation, {$<$}italic{$>$}in vivo{$<$}/italic{$>$} equivalent of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, can induce stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity (StTDP) of the FCs spontaneous and tone-evoked firing rates. In healthy guinea pigs, the resulting distribution of StTDP learning rules across a FC neural population is dominated by a Hebbian profile while anti-Hebbian, suppressive and enhancing LRs are less frequent. In this study, we investigate {$<$}italic{$>$}in vivo{$<$}/italic{$>$}, the NMDAr contribution to FC baseline activity and long term plasticity. We find that blocking the NMDAr decreases the synchronization of FC- spontaneous activity and mediates differential modulation of FC rate-level functions such that low, and high threshold units are more likely to increase, and decrease, respectively, their maximum amplitudes. Three significant alterations in mean learning-rule profiles were identified: transitions from an initial Hebbian profile towards (1) an anti-Hebbian; (2) a suppressive profile; and (3) transitions from an anti-Hebbian to a Hebbian profile. FC units preserving their learning rules showed instead, NMDAr-dependent plasticity to unimodal acoustic stimulation, with persistent depression of tone-evoked responses changing to persistent enhancement following the NMDAr antagonist. These results reveal a crucial role of the NMDAr in mediating FC baseline activity and long-term plasticity which have important implications for signal processing and auditory pathologies related to maladaptive plasticity of dorsal cochlear nucleus circuitry.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We obtained a 20-80\% rise time (tr) of approximately 80 micros at 22 degrees C, shorter than any previously reported values, and tr variability (SD) with an upper limit of 25-30 micros. Extracellular electrode pressure can increase tr and its variability by 2- to 3-fold. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled passive acetylcholine diffusion through a vesicle fusion pore expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(-1) (rapid, from endplate omega figure appearance) or 0.275 nm x ms(-1) (slow, from mast cell exocytosis). Simulated mEPCs obtained with rapid expansion reproduced tr and the overall shape of our experimental mEPCs, and were similar to simulated mEPCs obtained with instant acetylcholine release. We conclude that passive transmitter diffusion, coupled with rapid expansion of the fusion pore, is sufficient to explain the time course of experimentally measured synaptic currents with trs of less than 100 micros.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Calcium influx through the \emph{N}-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) are critical events in certain forms of synaptic plasticity. We have previously shown that autophosphorylation of CaMKII induces high-affinity binding to the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (Strack, S., and Colbran, R. J. (1998) \emph{J. Biol. Chem.} 273, 20689–20692). Here, we show that residues 1290–1309 in the cytosolic tail of NR2B are critical for CaMKII binding and identify by site-directed mutagenesis several key residues (Lys\textsuperscript{1292}, Leu\textsuperscript{1298}, Arg\textsuperscript{1299}, Arg\textsuperscript{1300}, Gln\textsuperscript{1301}, and Ser\textsuperscript{1303}). Phosphorylation of NR2B at Ser\textsuperscript{1303} by CaMKII inhibits binding and promotes slow dissociation of preformed CaMKII·NR2B complexes. Peptide competition studies imply a role for the CaMKII catalytic domain, but not the substrate-binding pocket, in the association with NR2B. However, analysis of monomeric CaMKII mutants indicates that the holoenzyme structure may also be important for stable association with NR2B. Residues 1260–1316 of NR2B are sufficient to direct the subcellular localization of CaMKII in intact cells and to confer dynamic regulation by calcium influx. Furthermore, mutation of residues in the CaMKII-binding domain in full-length NR2B bidirectionally modulates colocalization with CaMKII after NMDA receptor activation, suggesting a dynamic model for the translocation of CaMKII to postsynaptic targets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The activation of the dodecameric Ca2+/calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzyme is critical for memory formation. We now report that CaMKII has a remarkable property, which is that activation of the holoenzyme triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, including unactivated ones, enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation of new subunits. We show, using a single-molecule TIRF microscopy technique, that the exchange process is triggered by the activation of CaMKII, and that exchange is modulated by phosphorylation of two residues in the calmodulin-binding segment, Thr 305 and Thr 306. Based on these results, and on the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that the phosphorylated regulatory segment of CaMKII interacts with the central hub of the holoenzyme and weakens its integrity, thereby promoting exchange. Our results have implications for an earlier idea that subunit exchange in CaMKII may have relevance for information storage resulting from brief coincident stimuli during neuronal signaling.},

  abstract = {Complex biological systems operate under non-equilibrium conditions and exhibit emergent properties associated with correlated spatial and temporal structures. These properties may be individually unpredictable, but tend to be governed by power-law probability distributions and/or correlation. This article reviews the concepts that are invoked in the treatment of complex systems through a wide range of respiratory-related examples. Following a brief historical overview, some of the tools to characterize structural variabilities and temporal fluctuations associated with complex systems are introduced. By invoking the concept of percolation, the notion of multiscale behavior and related modeling issues are discussed. Spatial complexity is then examined in the airway and parenchymal structures with implications for gas exchange followed by a short glimpse of complexity at the cellular and subcellular network levels. Variability and complexity in the time domain are then reviewed in relation to temporal fluctuations in airway function. Next, an attempt is given to link spatial and temporal complexities through examples of airway opening and lung tissue viscoelasticity. Specific examples of possible and more direct clinical implications are also offered through examples of optimal future treatment of fibrosis, exacerbation risk prediction in asthma, and a novel method in mechanical ventilation. Finally, the potential role of the science of complexity in the future of physiology, biology, and medicine is discussed. © 2011 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 1:995-1029, 2011.},

These mechanisms are mediated by AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in postsynaptic neurons. However, the regulatory mechanism of bidirectional plasticity at excitatory synapses remains unclear. We present a network model of AMPAR trafficking for adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which reproduces both LTP and LTD. We show that the induction of both LTP and LTD is regulated by the competition between exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPARs, which are mediated by the calcium-sensors synaptotagmin 1/7 (Syt1/7) and protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1), respectively. Our result indicates that recycling endosomes containing AMPAR are always ready for Syt1/7-dependent exocytosis of AMPAR at peri-synaptic/synaptic membranes. This is because molecular motor myosin Vb constitutively transports the recycling endosome toward the membrane in a Ca2+-independent manner.},

Sensory paradigms utilising electroencephalography (EEG) and sensory stimulation to induce LTP have allowed translation from rodent and primate invasive research to non-invasive human investigations. This review focusses on visual sensory LTP induced using repetitive visual stimulation, resulting in changes in the visually evoked response recorded at the scalp with EEG. Across 15 years of use and replication in humans several major paradigm variants for eliciting visual LTP have emerged. The application of different paradigms, and the broad implementation of visual LTP across different populations combines to provide a rich and sensitive account of Hebbian LTP, and potentially non-Hebbian plasticity mechanisms. This review will conclude with a discussion of how these findings have advanced existing theories of perceptual learning by positioning Hebbian learning both alongside and within other major theories such as Predictive Coding and The Free Energy Principle.},

  abstract = {Understanding relationships between heart failure and arrhythmias, important causes of suffering and sudden death, remains an unmet goal for biomedical researchers and physicians. Evidence assembled over the past decade supports a view that activation of the multifunctional Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) favors myocardial dysfunction and cell membrane electrical instability. CaMKII activation follows increases in intracellular Ca2+ or oxidation, upstream signals with the capacity to transition CaMKII into a Ca2+ and calmodulin-independent constitutively active enzyme. Constitutively active CaMKII appears poised to participate in disease pathways by catalyzing the phosphorylation of classes of protein targets important for excitation–contraction coupling and cell survival, including ion channels and Ca2+ homeostatic proteins, and transcription factors that drive hypertrophic and inflammatory gene expression. This rich diversity of downstream targets helps to explain the potential for CaMKII to simultaneously affect mechanical and electrical properties of heart muscle cells. Proof-of-concept studies from a growing number of investigators show that CaMKII inhibition is beneficial for improving myocardial performance and for reducing arrhythmias. We review the molecular physiology of CaMKII and discuss CaMKII actions at key cellular targets and results of animal models of myocardial hypertrophy, dysfunction, and arrhythmias that suggest CaMKII inhibition may benefit myocardial function while reducing arrhythmias.},

  abstract = {Natural systems are, almost by definition, heterogeneous: this can be either a boon or an obstacle to be overcome, depending on the situation. Traditionally, when constructing mathematical models of these systems, heterogeneity has typically been ignored, despite its critical role. However, in recent years, stochastic computational methods have become commonplace in science. They are able to appropriately account for heterogeneity; indeed, they are based around the premise that systems inherently contain at least one source of heterogeneity (namely, intrinsic heterogeneity). In this mini-review, we give a brief introduction to theoretical modelling and simulation in systems biology and discuss the three different sources of heterogeneity in natural systems. Our main topic is an overview of stochastic simulation methods in systems biology. There are many different types of stochastic methods. We focus on one group that has become especially popular in systems biology, biochemistry, chemistry and physics. These discrete-state stochastic methods do not follow individuals over time; rather they track only total populations. They also assume that the volume of interest is spatially homogeneous. We give an overview of these methods, with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest when each is more appropriate to use. We also include references to software implementations of them, so that beginners can quickly start using stochastic methods for practical problems of interest.},

Acute inhibition of CaMKII erases LTP and transient inhibition of CaMKII enhances subsequent LTP. These findings strongly support the role of CaMKII as a molecular storage device.},

  abstract = {This document aims to agree on a broad, international strategy for the implementation of open scholarship that meets the needs of different national and regional communities but works globally.Scholarly research can be idealised as an inspirational process for advancing our collective knowledge to the benefit of all humankind. However, current research practices often struggle with a range of tensions, in part due to the fact that this collective (or “commons”) ideal conflicts with the competitive system in which most scholars work, and in part because much of the infrastructure of the scholarly world is becoming largely digital. What is broadly termed as Open Scholarship is an attempt to realign modern research practices with this ideal. We do not propose a definition of Open Scholarship, but recognise that it is a holistic term that encompasses many disciplines, practices, and principles, sometimes also referred to as Open Science or Open Research. We choose the term Open Scholarship to be more inclusive of these other terms. When we refer to science in this document, we do so historically and use it as shorthand for more general scholarship.The purpose of this document is to provide a concise analysis of where the global Open Scholarship movement currently stands: what the common threads and strengths are, where the greatest opportunities and challenges lie, and how we can more effectively work together as a global community to recognise and address the top strategic priorities. This document was inspired by the Foundations for OER Strategy Development and work in the FORCE11 Scholarly Commons Working Group, and developed by an open contribution working group.Our hope is that this document will serve as a foundational resource for continuing discussions and initiatives about implementing effective strategies to help streamline the integration of Open Scholarship practices into a modern, digital research culture. Through this, we hope to extend the reach and impact of Open Scholarship into a global context, making sure that it is truly open for all. We also hope that this document will evolve as the conversations around Open Scholarship progress, and help to provide useful insight for both global co-ordination and local action. We believe this is a step forward in making Open Scholarship the norm.Ultimately, we expect the impact of widespread adoption of Open Scholarship to be diverse. We expect novel research practices to accelerate the pace of innovation, and therefore stimulate critical industries around the world. We could also expect to see an increase in public trust of science and scholarship, as transparency becomes more normative. As such, we expect interest in Open Scholarship to increase at multiple levels, due to its inherent influence on society and global economics.},

Methods of detecting, correcting for, and preventing publication bias are reviewed. The design of the meta-analysis itself, and the studies included in it, are shown to be important among a number of sources of publication bias. Various factors influence an author's decision to submit results for publication. Journal editors and reviewers are crucial in deciding which studies to publish.

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Much attention has been given to develop AD treatments based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis; however, none of these drugs had good efficacy at improving cognitive functions in AD patients suggesting that Aβ might not be the disease origin. Thus, there are urgent needs for the development of new therapies that target on the proximal cause of AD. Cellular calcium (Ca2+) signals regulate important facets of neuronal physiology. An increasing body of evidence suggests that age-related dysregulation of neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis may play a proximal role in the pathogenesis of AD as disrupted Ca2+ could induce synaptic deficits and promote the accumulation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Given that Ca2+ disruption is ubiquitously involved in all AD pathologies, it is likely that using chemical agents or small molecules specific to Ca2+ channels or handling proteins on the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles to correct neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation could open up a new approach to AD prevention and treatment. This review summarizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ dysregulation with AD pathologies and discusses the possibility of correcting neuronal Ca2+ disruption as a therapeutic approach for AD.},

  abstract = {Recent structural information on ligand-gated glutamate receptors and newly-discovered clinical uses for NMDA receptor antagonists has renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms of drug action at these receptors. Although the voltage-dependence and calcium permeability of NMDA receptors are well-studied, the mechanisms affecting the time course of synaptic NMDA receptor activation may be of more therapeutic value by serving as a rheostat for the total synaptic response. The NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC time course has been thought of as a fixed parameter based simply on receptor subunit composition as variably constrained by anatomical and developmental expression patterns, albeit subject to modification by kinetic behaviors such as modal gating. However, the EPSC time course also can be manipulated by endogenous and exogenous ligands. In this commentary we discuss insights into the in situ composition and kinetic behavior of synaptic NMDA receptors and propose new opportunities to target modulatory sites on NMDA receptors and to develop useful therapeutics. The emerging data on the atomic structure of NMDA receptors and knowledge of the kinetics of native receptors in neurons provide a roadmap in this regard.

  abstract = {By definition, learning is the acquisition of new informa­tion, whereas memory is the retention of acquired informa­tion. The ability to learn and to remember is one of the most fun­damental features of the brain. Memory is often classified temporally: short-term memory has a time course of seconds to hours, whereas long-term memory has a time course of weeks, months, or years. The basis for temporal division of the memory process is revealed by several observations that newly formed short-term memories are more vulnerable to interferences and disruptions. One fundamental goal of neuroscience is to understand the organizing principles and the neural network mechanisms by which the brain encodes and processes information in real time. In single neuron studies, recorded activity of single neurons needs to be averaged over many trials or even using different animals in order to overcome its fir­ing variability, and to identify its event-related responses and encoding properties. However, the brain is unlikely to accom­plish its processing through many repetitions in order to seek out statistically meaningful results.},

  abstract = {The death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) regulates the synaptic movement of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Synaptic CaMKII accumulation is mediated via binding to the NMDA-receptor subunit GluN2B and is required for long-term potentiation (LTP). By contrast, long-term depression (LTD) instead requires specific suppression of this movement, which is mediated by competitive DAPK1 binding to GluN2B. We find here that DAPK1 localizes to synapses via two distinct mechanisms: basal localization requires F-actin, but retention of DAPK1 at synapses during LTD requires an additional binding mode, likely to GluN2B. While F-actin binding mediates DAPK1 enrichment at synapses, it is not sufficient to suppress synaptic CaMKII movement. However, it is a prerequisite that enables the additional LTD-specific binding mode of DAPK1, which in turn mediates suppression of the CaMKII movement. Thus, both modes of synaptic DAPK1 localization work together to regulate synaptic CaMKII localization and thereby synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Learning and memory are thought to require hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), and one of the few central dogmas of molecular neuroscience that has stood undisputed for more than three decades is that LTP induction requires enzymatic activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)1–3. However, as we delineate here, the experimental evidence is surprisingly far from conclusive. All previous interventions inhibiting enzymatic CaMKII activity and LTP4–8 also interfere with structural CaMKII roles, in particular binding to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B9–14. Thus, we here characterized and utilized complementary sets of new opto-/pharmaco-genetic tools to distinguish between enzymatic and structural CaMKII functions. Several independent lines of evidence demonstrated LTP induction by a structural function of CaMKII rather than by its enzymatic activity. The sole contribution of kinase activity was autoregulation of this structural role via T286 autophosphorylation, which explains why this distinction has been elusive for decades. Directly initiating the structural function in a manner that circumvented this T286 role was sufficient to elicit robust LTP, even when enzymatic CaMKII activity was blocked.},

Aside from being broadly distributed in the CNS and having indispensable functions in the brain, NMDAR has predominant roles in many physiological and pathological processes in a wide range of non-neuronal cells and tissues. The present review outlines current knowledge and understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological functions of NMDAR in the kidney, an essential excretory and endocrine organ responsible for the whole-body homeostasis. The review also explores the recent findings regarding signaling pathways involved in NMDAR-mediated responses in the kidney. As established from diverse lines of research reviewed here, basal levels of receptor activation within the kidney are essential for the maintenance of healthy tubular and glomerular function, while a disproportionate activation can lead to a disruption of NMDAR’s downstream signaling pathways and a myriad of pathophysiological consequences.},

  abstract = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are known for their role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we start by reviewing the early evidence for their role in LTP at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. We then discuss more recent evidence that NMDAR dependent synaptic plasticity at these synapses can be separated into mechanistically distinct components. An initial phase of the synaptic potentiation, which is generally termed short-term potentiation (STP), decays in an activity-dependent manner and comprises two components that differ in their kinetics and NMDAR subtype dependence. The faster component involves activation of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits whereas the slower component involves activation of GluN2B and GluN2D subunits. The stable phase of potentiation, commonly referred to as LTP, requires activation of primarily triheteromeric NMDARs containing both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. In new work, we compare STP with a rebound potentiation (RP) that is induced by NMDA application and conclude that they are different phenomena. We also report that NMDAR dependent long-term depression (NMDAR-LTD) is sensitive to a glycine site NMDAR antagonist. We conclude that NMDARs are not synonymous for either LTP or memory. Whilst important for the induction of LTP at many synapses in the CNS, not all forms of LTP require the activation of NMDARs. Furthermore, NMDARs mediate the induction of other forms of synaptic plasticity and are important for synaptic transmission. It is, therefore, not possible to equate NMDARs with LTP though they are intimately linked. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Brain and Memory.},

  abstract = {For decades, regulatory guidelines for safety assessment in rodents for drugs, chemicals, pesticides, and food additives with developmental neurotoxic potential have recommended a single test of learning and memory (L\&M). In recent years some agencies have requested two such tests. Given the importance of higher cognitive function to health, and the fact that different types of L\&M are mediated by different brain regions assessing higher functions represents a step forward in providing better evidence-based protection against adverse brain effects. Given the myriad of tests available for assessing L\&M in rodents this leads to the question of which tests best fit regulatory guidelines. To address this question, we begin by describing the central role of two types of L\&M essential to all mammalian species and the regions/networks that mediate them. We suggest that the tests recommended possess characteristics that make them well suited to the needs in regulatory safety studies. By brain region, these are (1) the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex for spatial navigation, which assesses explicit L\&M for reference and episodic memory and (2) the striatum and related structures for egocentric navigation, which assesses implicit or procedural memory and path integration. Of the tests available, we suggest that in this context, the evidence supports the use of water mazes, specifically, the Morris water maze (MWM) for spatial L\&M and the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) for egocentric/procedural L\&M. We review the evidentiary basis for these tests, describe their use, and explain procedures that optimize their sensitivity.},

Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

Calcium signals cause calcium-calmodulin to activate CaMKII, which leads to remodeling of the actin filament (F-actin) network in the spine. We elucidate the mechanism of the remodeling by combining computer simulations with protein array experiments and electron microscopic imaging, to arrive at a structural model for the dodecameric complex of CaMKII with F-actin. The binding interface involves multiple domains of CaMKII. This structure explains the architecture of the micrometer-scale CaMKII/F-actin bundles arising from the multivalence of CaMKII. We also show that the regulatory domain of CaMKII may bind either calmodulin or F-actin, but not both. This frustration, along with the multipartite nature of the binding interface, allows calmodulin transiently to strip CaMKII from actin assemblies so that they can reorganize. This observation therefore provides a simple mechanism by which the structural dynamics of CaMKII establishes the link between calcium signaling and the morphological plasticity of dendritic spines.},

We relate one flame war from the Computational Chemistry mailing List in order to assess in detail the relationships between modeling methods, parameterization, software and the various forms of their enclosure or disclosure. Our claim is that parameterization issues are a source of epistemic opacity and that this opacity is entangled in methods and software alike. Models and software must be addressed together to understand the epistemological tensions at stake.},

Albino rats were tested in a light–dark box where they had the choice between remaining in a dark compartment filling with isoflurane or CO2, or escaping to a lit compartment. Experiment 1 validated the procedure by confirming that rats responded to agent and light intensity. In experiment 2, 9/16 and 0/16 rats remained in the dark compartment until recumbent when initially exposed to isoflurane and CO2, respectively. In experiment 3, more rats remained in the dark compartment until recumbent during initial (10/16) versus re-exposure (1/16) to isoflurane. These results indicate that initial exposure to CO2 is more aversive than isoflurane, and that re-exposure to isoflurane is more aversive than initial exposure. We conclude that sedation with isoflurane is a refinement over euthanasia with CO2 alone for rats that have not been previously exposed to inhalant anaesthetics.},

  abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase that transmits calcium signals in various cellular processes. CaMKII is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) through a direct binding mechanism involving a regulatory C-terminal α-helix in CaMKII. The Ca2+/CaM binding triggers transphosphorylation of critical threonine residues proximal to the CaM-binding site leading to the autoactivated state of CaMKII. The demonstration of its critical roles in pathophysiological processes has elevated CaMKII to a key target in the management of numerous diseases. The molecule KN-93 is the most widely used inhibitor for studying the cellular and in vivo functions of CaMKII. It is widely believed that KN-93 binds directly to CaMKII, thus preventing kinase activation by competing with Ca2+/CaM. Herein, we employed surface plasmon resonance, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize this presumed interaction. Our results revealed that KN-93 binds directly to Ca2+/CaM and not to CaMKII. This binding would disrupt the ability of Ca2+/CaM to interact with CaMKII, effectively inhibiting CaMKII activation. Our findings also indicated that KN-93 can specifically compete with a CaMKIIδ-derived peptide for binding to Ca2+/CaM. As indicated by the surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry data, apparently at least two KN-93 molecules can bind to Ca2+/CaM. Our findings provide new insight into how in vitro and in vivo data obtained with KN-93 should be interpreted. They further suggest that other Ca2+/CaM-dependent, non-CaMKII activities should be considered in KN-93–based mechanism-of-action studies and drug discovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Various forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are initiated through synapse-specific increases in Ca2+ that are generated through the activation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels or NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors.Many of the effects of Ca2+ on synaptic efficiency are mediated through the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), which mediates Ca2+ stimulation of several enzymes that are crucial for synaptic plasticity. The affinity of CaM for most of these proteins is increased when the concentration of free Ca2+ increases. Therefore, CaM mediates activity-dependent stimulation of a family of enzymes that are important for synaptic plasticity.The unique regulatory properties of CaM allow various target enzymes with different Ca2+ sensitivities to be stimulated and to show varying degrees of positive cooperativity.Several novel CaM-binding proteins, including neuromodulin and neurogranin, localize and control the levels of free CaM in neurons. These IQ domain-containing proteins bind CaM with higher affinity in the absence of Ca2+ compared with in the presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, neuromodulin and neurogranin can be phosphorylated at sites within an IQ domain, which is also the CaM-binding domain. Consequently, activity-dependent Ca2+ increases the release of CaM from neuromodulin and neurogranin.Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a CaM-stimulated kinase, has a crucial role in several forms of LTP. CaMKII might contribute to LTP by augmenting the activity of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors and stimulating dendritic translation. CaMKIV phosphorylates the CREB (cAMP responsive element (CRE)-binding protein) binding protein (CBP), which is a necessary event for Ca2+ stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription and heterosynaptic late-phase LTP.Calcineurin, a CaM-stimulated protein phosphatase, is thought to catalyse the dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors, an important event in LTD.The CaM-stimulated adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC8 are thought to contribute to LTP by coupling activity-dependent Ca2+ increases to elevated cAMP. This cAMP signal activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and enhances the activity of AMPA. In addition, cAMP increases ERK/MAPK activity, a crucial activity for L-LTP.},

  abstract = {Regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is likely based on an auto-inhibitory mechanism in which a segment of the kinase occupies the catalytic site in the absence of calmodulin. We analyze potential auto-inhibitory associations by employing charge reversal and hydrophobic-to-charged residue mutagenesis. We identify interacting amino acid pairs by using double mutants to test which modification in the catalytic domain complements a given change in the auto-inhibitory domain. Our studies identify the core pseudosubstrate sequence (residues 297–300) but reveal that distinct sequences centered about the autophosphorylation site at Thr-286 are involved in the critical auto-inhibitory interactions. Individual changes in any of the residues Arg-274, His-282, Arg-283, Lys-291, Arg-297, Phe-293, and Asn-294 in the auto-inhibitory domain or their interacting partners in the catalytic domain produces an enhanced affinity for calmodulin or generates a constitutively active enzyme. A structural model of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that incorporates these interactions shows that Thr-286 is oriented inwardly into a hydrophobic channel. The model explains why calmodulin must bind to the auto-inhibitory domain in order for Thr-286 in that domain to be phosphorylated and why introduction of phospho-Thr-286 produces the important Ca2+-independent state of the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Background Memory deficits are central to many neuropsychiatric diseases. During acquisition of new information, memories can become vulnerable to interference, yet mechanisms that underlie interference are unknown. Methods We describe a novel transduction pathway that links the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) to AKT signaling via the immediate early gene Arc and evaluate its role in memory. The signaling pathway is validated using biochemical tools and transgenic mice, and function is evaluated in assays of synaptic plasticity and behavior. The translational relevance is evaluated in human postmortem brain. Results Arc is dynamically phosphorylated by CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and binds the NMDAR subunits NR2A/NR2B and a previously unstudied PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) adapter p55PIK (PIK3R3) in vivo in response to novelty or tetanic stimulation in acute slices. NMDAR-Arc-p55PIK recruits p110α PI3K and mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2) to activate AKT. NMDAR-Arc-p55PIK-PI3K-mTORC2-AKT assembly occurs within minutes of exploratory behavior and localizes to sparse synapses throughout hippocampal and cortical regions. Studies using conditional (Nestin-Cre) p55PIK deletion mice indicate that NMDAR-Arc-p55PIK-PI3K-mTORC2-AKT functions to inhibit GSK3 and mediates input-specific metaplasticity that protects potentiated synapses from subsequent depotentiation. p55PIK conditional knockout mice perform normally in multiple behaviors including working memory and long-term memory tasks but exhibit deficits indicative of increased vulnerability to interference in both short-term and long-term paradigms. The NMDAR-AKT transduction complex is reduced in postmortem brain of individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease. Conclusions A novel function of Arc mediates synapse-specific NMDAR-AKT signaling and metaplasticity that contributes to memory updating and is disrupted in human cognitive disease.},

  abstract = {Calcium–calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is the most abundant protein in excitatory synapses and is central to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. It is activated by intracellular increases in calcium ion levels and triggers molecular processes necessary for synaptic plasticity. CaMKII phosphorylates numerous synaptic proteins, thereby regulating their structure and functions. This leads to molecular events crucial for synaptic plasticity, such as receptor trafficking, localization and activity; actin cytoskeletal dynamics; translation; and even transcription through synapse–nucleus shuttling. Several new tools affording increasingly greater spatiotemporal resolution have revealed the link between CaMKII activity and downstream signalling processes in dendritic spines during synaptic and behavioural plasticity. These technologies have provided insights into the function of CaMKII in learning and memory.},

  abstract = {Despite, and perhaps because of its amorphous nature, the term "academic success" is one of the most widely used constructs in educational research and assessment within higher education. This paper conducts an analytic literature review to examine the use and operationalization of the term in multiple academic fields. Dominant definitions of the term are conceptually evaluated using Astin's I-E-O model resulting in the proposition of a revised definition and new conceptual model of academic success. Measurements of academic success found throughout the literature are presented in accordance with the presented model of academic success. These measurements are provided with details in a user-friendly table (Appendix B). Results also indicate that grades and GPA are the most commonly used measure of academic success. Finally, recommendations are given for future research and practice to increase effective assessment of academic success.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are morphological specializations that receive synaptic inputs and compartmentalize calcium. In spite of a long history of research, the specific function of spines is still not well understood. Here we review the current status of the relation between morphological changes in spines and synaptic plasticity. Since Cajal and Tanzi proposed that changes in the structure of the brain might occur as a consequence of experience, the search for the morphological correlates of learning has constituted one of the central questions in neuroscience. Although there are scores of studies that encompass this wide field in many species, in this review we focus on experimental work that has analyzed the morphological consequences of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. Over the past two decades many studies have demonstrated changes in the morphology of spines after LTP, such as enlargements of the spine head and shortenings of the spine neck. Biophysically, these changes translate into an increase in the synaptic current injected at the spine, as well as shortening of the time constant for calcium compartmentalization. In addition, recent online studies using time-lapse imaging have reported increased spinogenesis. The currently available data show a strong correlation between synaptic plasticity and morphological changes in spines, although at the same time, there is no evidence that these morphological changes are necessary or sufficient for the induction or maintenance of LTP. Still, they highlight once more how form and function go hand in hand in the central nervous system.},

Here we highlight the functional contribution of newly described long-range connections between hippocampus and cortical areas, and the relative impact of inhibitory and excitatory dynamics in generating behaviorally relevant population activity.

  abstract = {The NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor interacts with several prominent proteins in the postsynaptic density, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). To determine the function of these interactions, we derived transgenic mice expressing a ligand-activated carboxy-terminal NR2B fragment (cNR2B) by fusing this fragment to a tamoxifen (TAM)-dependent mutant of the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain LBDG521R. Here, we show that induction by TAM allows the transgenic cNR2B fragment to bind to endogenous CaMKII in neurons. Activation of the LBDG521R-cNR2B transgenic protein in mice leads to the disruption of CaMKII/NR2B interactions at synapses. The disruption decreases Thr286 phosphorylation of αCaMKII, lowers phosphorylation of a key CaMKII substrate in the postsynaptic membrane (AMPA receptor subunit glutamate receptor 1), and produces deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning. Together our results demonstrate the importance of interactions between CaMKII and NR2B for CaMKII activity, synaptic plasticity, and learning.},

  abstract = {Hypertension is a major adverse effect of calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine, used clinically as immunosuppressants. Calcineurin inhibitor-induced hypertension (CIH) is linked to augmented sympathetic output from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). GluA2-lacking, Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) are a key feature of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, yet their role in CIH remains elusive. Here, we found that systemic administration of FK506 in rats significantly increased serine phosphorylation of GluA1 and GluA2 in PVN synaptosomes. Strikingly, FK506 treatment reduced GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in both synaptosomes and endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions from the PVN. Blocking CP-AMPARs with IEM-1460 induced a larger reduction of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (AMPAR-EPSC) amplitudes in retrogradely labelled, spinally projecting PVN neurons in FK506-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, FK506 treatment shifted the current–voltage relationship of AMPAR-EPSCs from linear to inward rectification in labelled PVN neurons. FK506 treatment profoundly enhanced physical interactions of α2δ-1 with GluA1 and GluA2 in the PVN. Inhibiting α2δ-1 with gabapentin, α2δ-1 genetic knockout, or disrupting α2δ-1–AMPAR interactions with an α2δ-1 C terminus peptide restored GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in the PVN and diminished inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in labelled PVN neurons induced by FK506 treatment. Additionally, microinjection of IEM-1460 or α2δ-1 C terminus peptide into the PVN reduced renal sympathetic nerve discharges and arterial blood pressure elevated in FK506-treated rats but not in vehicle-treated rats. Thus, calcineurin in the hypothalamus constitutively regulates AMPAR subunit composition and phenotypes by controlling GluA1/GluA2 interactions with α2δ-1. Synaptic CP-AMPARs in PVN presympathetic neurons contribute to augmented sympathetic outflow in CIH. Key points Systemic treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor increases serine phosphorylation of synaptic GluA1 and GluA2 in the PVN. Calcineurin inhibition enhances the prevalence of postsynaptic Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in PVN presympathetic neurons. Calcineurin inhibition potentiates α2δ-1 interactions with GluA1 and GluA2, disrupting intracellular assembly of GluA1/GluA2 heterotetramers in the PVN. Blocking Ca2+-permeable AMPARs or α2δ-1–AMPAR interactions in the PVN attenuates sympathetic outflow augmented by the calcineurin inhibitor.},
