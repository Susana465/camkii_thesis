  abstract = {The paramount feature of long-term potentiation (LTP) as a memory mechanism is its characteristic persistence over time. Although the basic phenomenology of LTP persistence was established 30 years ago, new insights have emerged recently about the extent of LTP persistence and its regulation by activity and experience. Thus, it is now evident that LTP, at least in the dentate gyrus, can either be decremental, lasting from hours to weeks, or stable, lasting months or longer. Although mechanisms engaged during the induction of LTP regulate its subsequent persistence, the maintenance of LTP is also governed by activity patterns post-induction, whether induced experimentally or generated by experience. These new findings establish dentate gyrus LTP as a useful model system for studying the mechanisms governing the induction, maintenance and interference with long-term memory, including very long-term memory lasting months or longer. The challenge is to study LTP persistence in other brain areas, and to relate, if possible, the properties and regulation of LTP maintenance to these same properties of the information that is actually stored in those regions.},

  abstract = {Memory is fundamentally important to everyday life, and memory loss has devastating consequences to individuals and society. Understanding the neurophysiological and cellular basis of memory paves the way for gaining insights into the molecular steps involved in memory formation, thereby revealing potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. For three decades, long-term potentiation (LTP) has been the gold standard synaptic model for mammalian memory mechanisms, in large part because of its long-lasting nature. Here, the authors summarize the characteristics of LTP persistence in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, comparing this with other hippocampal subregions and neocortex. They consider how long LTP can last and how its persistence is affected by subsequent behavioral experiences. Next, they review the molecular mechanisms known to contribute to LTP induction and persistence, in particular the role of new gene expression and protein synthesis and how they may be associated with potential structural reorganization of the synapse. A temporal schema for the processes important for consolidating LTP into a persistent form is presented. The parallels between the molecular aspects of LTP and memory strongly support the continuation with LTP as a model system for studying the mechanisms underlying long-term memory consolidation and retention.},

Hebb’s seminal work foreshadowed some of the great neuroscientific discoveries of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term potentiation and other lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, and more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community’s best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates. In this review, we address the key findings from the synaptic plasticity literature that make these phenomena such attractive memory mechanisms. We then turn our attention to evidence that questions the reliance of memory exclusively on changes at the synapse and attempt to integrate these opposing views.},

Unethical research in the field of neuroscience also proved to be incredibly distressing. Participants were often left with life-long cognitive disabilities. This emphasizes the importance of implicating strict rules and ethical guidelines in neuroscience research that protect participants and respects their dignity. The experiments conducted by German Nazi in the concentration camps during WWII are probably the most inhumane and brutal ever conducted. The Nuremberg Code of 1947, one of the few positive outcomes of the Nazi experiments, is often considered the first document to set out ethical regulations of human research. It consists of numerous necessary criteria, to highlight a few, the subject must give informed consent, there must be a concrete scientific basis for the experiment, and the experiment should yield positive results that cannot be obtained in any other way. In the end, we must remember, the interest of the patient must always prevail over the interest of science or society.},

In the central nervous system (CNS), LTP has been recorded at numerous synapses and is a prime candidate mechanism associating activity-dependent plasticity with learning and memory. LTP involves long-lasting increase in synaptic strength with various underlying mechanisms. In the CNS, the predominant type of LTP is believed to be dependent on activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is highly calcium-permeable. However, various forms of NMDAR-independent LTP have been identified in diverse areas of the nervous system. The NMDAR-independent LTP may require activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) or ionotropic receptors other than NMDAR such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor or calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR). In this review, NMDAR-independent LTP of various areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the advent of soft robotics has changed the landscape of wearable technologies. Soft robots are highly compliant and malleable, thus ensuring safe human-machine interactions. To date, a wide variety of actuation mechanisms have been studied and adopted into a multitude of soft wearables for use in clinical practice, such as assistive devices and rehabilitation modalities. Much research effort has been put into improving their technical performance and establishing the ideal indications for which rigid exoskeletons would play a limited role. However, despite having achieved many feats over the past decade, soft wearable technologies have not been extensively investigated from the perspective of user adoption. Most scholarly reviews of soft wearables have focused on the perspective of service providers such as developers, manufacturers, or clinicians, but few have scrutinized the factors affecting adoption and user experience. Hence, this would pose a good opportunity to gain insight into the current practice of soft robotics from a user's perspective. This review aims to provide a broad overview of the different types of soft wearables and identify the factors that hinder the adoption of soft robotics. In this paper, a systematic literature search using terms such as "soft", "robot", "wearable", and "exoskeleton" was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines to include peer-reviewed publications between 2012 and 2022. The soft robotics were classified according to their actuation mechanisms into motor-driven tendon cables, pneumatics, hydraulics, shape memory alloys, and polyvinyl chloride muscles, and their pros and cons were discussed. The identified factors affecting user adoption include design, availability of materials, durability, modeling and control, artificial intelligence augmentation, standardized evaluation criteria, public perception related to perceived utility, ease of use, and aesthetics. The critical areas for improvement and future research directions to increase adoption of soft wearables have also been highlighted.},

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of orexin-A on the performance of Wistar rats during the Morris water maze test and then to determine the effects of orexin-A on both the long-term potentiation and long-term depression in Schaffer collateral/commissural-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. The results of the Morris water maze test show that 1.0 and 10 nmol of orexin-A, when administered intracerebroventricularly, retarded spatial learning. A probe test examined after training of water maze task also showed an impairment in spatial memory. The results of an electrophysiological study using hippocampal slices demonstrated that 1.0 to 30 nM of orexin-A applied to the perfusate produces a dose-dependent and time dependent suppression of the long-term potentiation. In addition, the long-term depression was not affected by orexin-A. The results of a paired-pulse facilitation experiment indicated that the effects of orexin-A were post-synaptic and not due to presynaptic transmitter release. These results show that orexin-A impairs spatial performance and these impairments can be attributed to a suppression of long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 hippocampal synapses.},

Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald as they explore the hidden biases we all carry from a lifetime of exposure to cultural attitudes about age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, social class, sexuality, disability status, and nationality.“Blindspot” is the authors’ metaphor for the portion of the mind that houses hidden biases. Writing with simplicity and verve, Banaji and Greenwald question the extent to which our perceptions of social groups—without our awareness or conscious control—shape our likes and dislikes and our judgments about people’s character, abilities, and potential.In Blindspot, the authors reveal hidden biases based on their experience with the Implicit Association Test, a method that has revolutionized the way scientists learn about the human mind and that gives us a glimpse into what lies within the metaphoric blindspot.The title’s “good people” are those of us who strive to align our behavior with our intentions. The aim of Blindspot is to explain the science in plain enough language to help well-intentioned people achieve that alignment. By gaining awareness, we can adapt beliefs and behavior and “outsmart the machine” in our heads so we can be fairer to those around us. Venturing into this book is an invitation to understand our own minds.Brilliant, authoritative, and utterly accessible, Blindspot is a book that will challenge and change readers for years to come.Praise for Blindspot“Conversational . . . easy to read, and best of all, it has the potential, at least, to change the way you think about yourself.”—Leonard Mlodinow, The New York Review of Books “Banaji and Greenwald deserve a major award for writing such a lively and engaging book that conveys an important message: Mental processes that we are not aware of can affect what we think and what we do.

  abstract = {Synaptic receptors in the human brain consist of multiple protein subunits, many of which have multiple variants, coded by different genes, and are differentially expressed across brain regions and developmental stages. The brain can tune the electrophysiological properties of synapses to regulate plasticity and information processing by switching from one protein variant to another. Such condition-dependent variant switch during development has been demonstrated in several neurotransmitter systems including NMDA and GABA. Here we systematically detect pairs of receptor-subunit variants that switch during the lifetime of the human brain by analyzing postmortem expression data collected in a population of donors at various ages and brain regions measured using microarray and RNA-seq. To further detect variant pairs that co-vary across subjects, we present a method to quantify age-corrected expression correlation in face of strong temporal trends. This is achieved by computing the correlations in the residual expression beyond a cubic-spline model of the population temporal trend, and can be seen as a nonlinear version of partial correlations. Using these methods, we detect multiple new pairs of context dependent variants. For instance, we find a switch from GLRA2 to GLRA3 that differs from the known switch in the rat. We also detect an early switch from HTR1A to HTR5A whose trends are negatively correlated and find that their age-corrected expression is strongly positively correlated. Finally, we observe that GRIN2B switch to GRIN2A occurs mostly during embryonic development, presumably earlier than observed in rodents. These results provide a systematic map of developmental switching in the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain.},

Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

  abstract = {Binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B is an important control mechanism for the regulation of synaptic strength. CaMKII binding to GluN2B and CaMKII translocation to synapses are induced by an initial Ca2+/CaM stimulus, which also activates the kinase. Indeed, several mechanistically different CaMKII inhibitors [tatCN21 and KN-93 (N-[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-propen\hspace{0pt}yl]methylamino]methyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4\hspace{0pt}-methoxybenzenesulphonamide)] and inactivating mutations (K42M, A302R, and T305/T306D) impair this interaction, suggesting that it requires CaMKII enzymatic activity. However, this study shows that two general kinase inhibitors, H7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine] and staurosporine (Sta), which inhibit CaMKII activity by yet another mechanism, did not interfere with GluN2B binding in vitro or within cells. In contrast to a previous report, we found that Sta, like H7, inhibited CaMKII in an ATP-competitive manner. Nucleotide binding significantly enhances CaMKII/GluN2B binding in vitro, but the nucleotide competition by H7 or Sta did not prevent this effect and instead even mimicked it. H7 (700 µM) and Sta (2 µM) efficiently blocked enzymatic activity of CaMKII, both in vitro and within cells. However, neither H7 nor Sta prevented Ca2+-induced translocation of CaMKII to GluN2B in heterologous cells or to synapses in hippocampal neurons. Thus, activity of CaMKII (or of any other kinase inhibited by H7 or Sta) is not required for stimulation-induced GluN2B-binding or synaptic translocation of CaMKII, despite previous indication to the contrary. This shows that results with inhibitors and inhibiting mutants can be caused by structural effects independent from catalytic activity, and that detailed understanding of the mechanisms is required for their interpretation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Learning, memory, and cognition are thought to require normal long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength, which in turn requires binding of the Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2B. For LTP induction, many additional required players are known. Here we tested the hypothesis that CaMKII/GluN2B binding also mediates the more elusive maintenance of synaptic strength. Intriguingly, the CaMKII inhibitor tatCN21 reduces synaptic strength only at high concentrations necessary for CaMKII/NMDAR disruption (20 μm) but not at lower concentrations sufficient for kinase inhibition (5 μm). However, increased concentration also causes unrelated effects. Thus, to distinguish between correlation and causality, we used a pharmacogenetic approach. In a mouse with a mutant NMDAR GluN2B subunit that is CaMKII binding-incompetent, any tatCN21 effects that are specific to the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction should be abolished, and any remaining tatCN21 effects have to be nonspecific (\emph{i.e.} mediated by other targets). The results showed that the persistent reduction of synaptic strength by transient application of 20 μm tatCN21 had a nonspecific presynaptic component (on fiber volley amplitude) that was unrelated to the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction or CaMKII activity. However, the remaining component of the persistent tatCN21 effect was almost completely abolished in the GluN2B mutant mouse. These results highlight the requirement for stringent pharmacogenetic approaches to separate specific on-target effects from nonspecific off-target effects. Importantly, they also demonstrate that the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction is required not only for normal LTP induction but also for the maintenance of synaptic strength.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We have built a stochastic model in the program MCell that simulates Ca2+ transients in spines from the principal molecular components believed to control Ca2+ entry and exit. Proteins, with their kinetic models, are located within two segments of dendrites containing 88 intact spines, centered in a fully reconstructed 6 × 6 × 5 μm3 cube of hippocampal neuropil. Protein components include AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, L- and R-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases, smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases, immobile Ca2+ buffers, and calbindin. Kinetic models for each protein were taken from published studies of the isolated proteins in vitro. For simulation of electrical stimuli, the time course of voltage changes in the dendritic spine was generated with the desired stimulus in the program NEURON. Voltage-dependent parameters were then continuously re-adjusted during simulations in MCell to reproduce the effects of the stimulus. Nine parameters of the model were optimized within realistic experimental limits by a process that compared results of simulations to published data. We find that simulations in the optimized model reproduce the timing and amplitude of Ca2+ transients measured experimentally in intact neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that the characteristics of individual isolated proteins determined in vitro can accurately reproduce the dynamics of experimentally measured Ca2+ transients in spines. The model will provide a test bed for exploring the roles of additional proteins that regulate Ca2+ influx into spines and for studying the behavior of protein targets in the spine that are regulated by Ca2+ influx.},

  abstract = {Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) at synapses in the CNS triggers changes in synaptic strength that underlie memory formation in response to strong synaptic stimuli. The primary target of Ca2+ flowing through NMDARs is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) which forms dodecameric holoenzymes that are highly concentrated at the postsynaptic site. Activation of CaMKII is necessary to trigger long-term potentiation of synaptic strength (LTP), and is prolonged by autophosphorylation of subunits within the holoenzyme. Here we use MCell4, an agent-based, stochastic, modeling platform to model CaMKII holoenzymes placed within a realistic spine geometry. We show how two mechanisms of regulation of CaMKII, ‘Ca2+-calmodulin-trapping (CaM-trapping)’ and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) shape the autophosphorylation response during a repeated high-frequency stimulus. Our simulation results suggest that autophosphorylation of CaMKII does not constitute a bistable switch. Instead, prolonged but temporary, autophosphorylation of CaMKII may contribute to a biochemical-network-based ‘kinetic proof-reading” mechanism that controls induction of synaptic plasticity.},

However, current mechanistic models require fundamental revision. CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 (pThr286) does not provide the molecular basis for long-term memory, as long believed. Instead, pThr286 mediates the signal processing required for induction of several distinct forms of synaptic plasticity, including Hebbian long-term potentiation and depression and non-Hebbian behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity. We discuss (i) the molecular computations by which CaMKII supports these diverse plasticity mechanisms, (ii) alternative CaMKII mechanisms that may contribute to the maintenance phase of LTP and (iii) the relationship of these mechanisms to behavioral learning and memory.},

  abstract = {Activity-dependent plasticity is a fundamental feature of most CNS synapses and is thought to be a synaptic correlate of memory in rodents. In humans, NMDA receptors have been linked to verbal memory processes, but it is unclear whether NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity can be recruited for information storage in the human CNS. Here we have for the first time analyzed different forms of synaptic plasticity in human hippocampus. In human subjects who show a morphologically intact hippocampus that is not the primary seizure focus, NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and forskolin-induced long-lasting potentiation are readily induced at the perforant path–dentate gyrus synapse. In this group, long-term potentiation could be partially depotentiated by low-frequency stimulation. Because patients with a hippocampal seizure focus showed a marked reduction in verbal memory performance in previous studies, we asked whether synaptic plasticity is similarly affected by the presence of a hippocampal primary seizure focus. We found that the amount of potentiation induced by high-frequency stimulation or perfusion of forskolin is dramatically reduced in this patient group. In addition, low-frequency stimulation is not effective in inducing synaptic depression. In summary, we show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity with properties similar to the rodent is available for information storage in the human hippocampus. Because both verbal memory processes and synaptic plasticity are impaired by a hippocampal seizure focus, we suggest that impaired synaptic plasticity may contribute to deficient declarative memory in human temporal lobe epilepsy.},

The NIH mandated enrollment of women in human clinical trials in 1993, but no similar initiatives exist to foster research on female animals. We reviewed sex bias in research on mammals in 10 biological fields for 2009 and their historical precedents. Male bias was evident in 8 disciplines and most prominent in neuroscience, with single-sex studies of male animals outnumbering those of females 5.5 to 1. In the past half-century, male bias in non-human studies has increased while declining in human studies. Studies of both sexes frequently fail to analyze results by sex. Underrepresentation of females in animal models of disease is also commonplace, and our understanding of female biology is compromised by these deficiencies. The majority of articles in several journals are conducted on rats and mice to the exclusion of other useful animal models. The belief that non-human female mammals are intrinsically more variable than males and too troublesome for routine inclusion in research protocols is without foundation. We recommend that when only one sex is studied, this should be indicated in article titles, and that funding agencies favor proposals that investigate both sexes and analyze data by sex.},

LTP was analyzed with full input-output curves for population spike (PS) amplitudes (PS-LTP) calculated from responses elicited in the CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus by monosynaptic activation. A standardized protocol employing a sequence of stimuli was devised to systematically compare LTP in the dentate gyrus to that in the CA1 region in rats of various ages ranging from postnatal day (PN) 6 to adults (PN 60). In adult animals, the degrees of LTP were comparable in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region for the 3 stimulus strengths studied (intensity just subthreshold for PS, intensity giving 14 maximal PS, and intensity giving 12 maximal PS). LTP developed at different rates in the two regions, reaching adult values about two weeks after birth in CA1 but about 3 weeks after birth in the dentate gyrus. We postulate that differences in the rate of development in CA1 and in the dentate gyrus are related to the later neurogenesis of dentate granule cells and also possibly to a later functional maturation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-channel complexes on these cells.},

RESULTS: In Part I,2-Reference Part I we learn that the above four variables did not influence two-thirds of the African-American patient's psychiatric diagnoses; however, excluding patients with multiple diagnoses, 26.7\% of the patient's diagnoses were shaped by these variables. Of these, 20\% (18 of 88 patients), or 5.5\% of the total 330 patients, had diagnoses that were strongly influenced by childhood traumatic experiences. Accordingly, we present two case histories that explicate the psychopathology seen in African-Americans traumatized as children. CONCLUSIONS: This study helps to stress and confirm the importance of how understanding childhood traumatic experiences shape adult African-American psychopathology and the potential for misdiagnosis - an important factor for prevention and appropriate treatment of African-American patients with psychiatric issues.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses can undergo postsynaptically expressed long-term depression (LTD) or long-term potentiation (LTP). PF-LTD induction requires the coactivity of the PF and CF (climbing fiber) inputs to PCs and a concomitant calcium transient and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). PF-LTP can be induced by PF activity alone and requires a lower calcium transient for its induction than PF-LTD. The cellular events triggering PF-LTP induction are not well characterized. At other types of synapses (e.g., in the hippocampus), bidirectional synaptic plasticity is under control of a kinase/phosphatase switch, with PKC and CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) activity promoting LTP induction and phosphatase activity promoting LTD induction. Here, we have tested for the involvement of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), PP2A, and PP2B (calcineurin) in cerebellar LTP induction using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat cerebellar slices. LTP induction was blocked in the presence of the PP1/2A inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin LR, the PP1 inhibitory peptide inhibitor-2, the PP2A inhibitor fostriecin, and the PP2B inhibitor cyclosporin A. LTP induction was not impaired by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Conversely, LTD induction was not blocked by microcystin LR but instead was reduced when active PP2B was injected into PCs. These data indicate that a kinase/phosphatase switch controls bidirectional cerebellar plasticity, but in a manner “inverse” to the dependencies found at other types of synapses. Therefore, cerebellar LTP constitutes the only form of LTP described so far that depends on phosphatase rather than kinase activity.},

  abstract = {A calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been purified from rat brain. It was monitored during the purification by its ability to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synapsin I. A 300-fold purification was sufficient to produce kinase that is 90-95\% pure as determined by scans of stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has a specific activity of 2.9 mumol of 32P transferred per min/mg of protein. Thus, the kinase is a relatively abundant brain enzyme, perhaps comprising as much as 0.3\% of the total brain protein. The Stokes radius (95 A) and sedimentation coefficient (16.4 S) of the kinase indicate a holoenzyme molecular weight of approximately 650,000. The holoenzyme is composed of three subunits as judged by their co-migration with kinase activity during the purification steps and co-precipitation with kinase activity by a specific anti-kinase monoclonal antibody. The three subunits have molecular weights of 50,000, 58,000, and 60,000, and have been termed alpha, beta', and beta, respectively. The alpha- and beta-subunits are distinct peptides, however, beta' may have been generated from beta by proteolysis. All three of these subunits bind calmodulin in the presence of calcium and are autophosphorylated under conditions in which the kinase is active. The subunits are present in a ratio of about 3 alpha-subunits to 1 beta/beta'-subunit. We therefore postulate that the 650,000-Da holoenzyme consists of approximately 9 alpha-subunits and 3 beta/beta'-subunits. The abundance of this calmodulin-dependent protein kinase indicates that its activation is likely to be an important biochemical response to increases in calcium ion concentration in neuronal tissue.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling and computational analyses of biological systems generally pose to modelers questions like: “Which modeling approach is suitable to describe the system we are interested in? Which computational tools do we need to simulate and analyze this system? What kind of predictions the model is expected to give?”. To answer these questions, some general tips are here suggested to choose the proper modeling approach according to the size of the system, the desired level of detail for the system description, the availability of experimental data and the computational costs of the analyses that the model will require. The attention is then focused on the numerous advantages of reaction-based modeling, such as its high level of detail and easy understandability, or the possibility to run both deterministic and stochastic simulations exploiting the same model. Some notes on the computational methods required to analyze reaction-based models, as well as their parallelization on Graphics Processing Units, are finally provided.},

  abstract = {Activation triggers the exchange of subunits in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an oligomeric enzyme that is critical for learning, memory, and cardiac function. The mechanism by which subunit exchange occurs remains elusive. We show that the human CaMKII holoenzyme exists in dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, and that the calmodulin (CaM)-binding element of CaMKII can bind to the hub of the holoenzyme and destabilize it to release dimers. The structures of CaMKII from two distantly diverged organisms suggest that the CaM-binding element of activated CaMKII acts as a wedge by docking at intersubunit interfaces in the hub. This converts the hub into a spiral form that can release or gain CaMKII dimers. Our data reveal a three-way competition for the CaM-binding element, whereby phosphorylation biases it towards the hub interface, away from the kinase domain and calmodulin, thus unlocking the ability of activated CaMKII holoenzymes to exchange dimers with unactivated ones.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that is ubiquitously expressed throughout the human body. Specialized isoforms of CaMKII play key roles in neuronal and cardiac signaling. The distinctive holoenzyme architecture of CaMKII, with 12–14 kinase domains attached by flexible linkers to a central hub, poses formidable challenges for structural characterization. Nevertheless, progress in determining the structural mechanisms underlying CaMKII functions has come from studying the kinase domain and the hub separately, as well as from a recent electron microscopic investigation of the intact holoenzyme. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the structure of CaMKII. We also discuss the intriguing finding that the CaMKII holoenzyme can undergo activation-triggered subunit exchange, a process that has implications for the potentiation and perpetuation of CaMKII activity.},

Components attributed to excitatory synaptic current flow and to action potentials in the granule cell population were distinguishable, with characteristics largely the same as in anaesthetized rabbits. 3. Stimulation at 15/sec for several seconds usually led to the granule cells being more effectively activated by the individual stimuli of the train (‘frequency potentiation’). Single stimuli then commonly produced multiple discharges in the granule cell population. 4. After single periods of stimulation at 15/sec for 15–20 sec there was on 26\% of the occasions (41\% of those on which there was good frequency potentiation) a long-lasting potentiation of the responses to subsequent stimuli, lasting from 1 hr to 3 days. 5. After a further 20\% of the periods of repetitive stimulation there was a shorter lasting potentiation, and after 8\% there was a short lasting depression. 6. The potentiation, when present, was characterized by some or all of the following changes: increases in the amplitudes of the synaptic wave and population spike, reduction in the latency of the population spike, and reductions in the variability of the characteristics of the population spike. 7. During the long-lasting potentiation there was an increase in the excitability of the post-synaptic cells and, on some but not all occasions, an increase in the extracellular current flow produced directly by synaptic action.},

  abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane. 2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10–20/sec for 10–15 sec, or 100/sec for 3–4 sec. 3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells. 4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments. 5. During conditioning at 10–20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (‘frequency potentiation’). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation. 6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

  abstract = {The paramount feature of long-term potentiation (LTP) as a memory mechanism is its characteristic persistence over time. Although the basic phenomenology of LTP persistence was established 30 years ago, new insights have emerged recently about the extent of LTP persistence and its regulation by activity and experience. Thus, it is now evident that LTP, at least in the dentate gyrus, can either be decremental, lasting from hours to weeks, or stable, lasting months or longer. Although mechanisms engaged during the induction of LTP regulate its subsequent persistence, the maintenance of LTP is also governed by activity patterns post-induction, whether induced experimentally or generated by experience. These new findings establish dentate gyrus LTP as a useful model system for studying the mechanisms governing the induction, maintenance and interference with long-term memory, including very long-term memory lasting months or longer. The challenge is to study LTP persistence in other brain areas, and to relate, if possible, the properties and regulation of LTP maintenance to these same properties of the information that is actually stored in those regions.},

  abstract = {The transient activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system by high frequency (tetanic) stimulation results in a rapidly developing and long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This potentiation can be divided into an early decremental component, known as short-term potentiation (STP), and a more slowly developing persistent phase, termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we describe how activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), by aminocyclopentane-1S,3R-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), can induce the same stable form of LTP, but without the STP component. 1S,3R-ACPD-induced LTP does not require electrical stimulation during its induction, but is dependent on an intact connection between the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. 1S,3R-ACPD-induced LTP circumvents the need for the activation of NMDA receptors and is likely to involve both the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.},

The main components of the platform are the Kappa Simulator, the Kappa Static Analyzer and the Kappa Story Extractor. In addition to these components, we describe the Kappa User Interface, which includes a range of interactive visualization tools for rule-based models needed to make sense of the complexity of biological systems. We argue that, in this approach, modeling is akin to programming and can likewise benefit from an integrated development environment. Our platform is a step in this direction.We discuss details about the computation and rendering of static, dynamic, and causal views of a model, which include the contact map (CM), snaphots at different resolutions, the dynamic influence network (DIN) and causal compression. We provide use cases illustrating how these concepts generate insight. Specifically, we show how the CM and snapshots provide information about systems capable of polymerization, such as Wnt signaling. A well-understood model of the KaiABC oscillator, translated into Kappa from the literature, is deployed to demonstrate the DIN and its use in understanding systems dynamics. Finally, we discuss how pathways might be discovered or recovered from a rule-based model by means of causal compression, as exemplified for early events in EGF signaling.The Kappa platform is available via the project website at kappalanguage.org. All components of the platform are open source and freely available through the authors’ code repositories.},

  abstract = {The fields of Neurobiology and Neuromodulation have never been closer. Consequently, the phrase “synaptic plasticity” has become very familiar to non-basic scientists, without actually being very familiar. We present the “Story of the AMPA receptor,” an easy-to-understand “10,000 ft” narrative overview of synaptic plasticity, oriented toward the brain stimulation clinician or scientist without basic science training. Neuromodulation is unparalleled in its capacity to both modulate and probe plasticity, yet many are not comfortable with their grasp of the topic. Here, we describe the seminal discoveries that defined the canonical mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and homeostatic plasticity. We then provide a conceptual framework for how plasticity at the synapse is accomplished, describing the functional roles of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and calcium, their effect on calmodulin, phosphatases (ie, calcineurin), kinases (ie, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase [CaMKII]), and structural “scaffolding” proteins (ie, post-synaptic density protein [PSD-95]). Ultimately, we describe how these affect the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor. More specifically, AMPA receptor delivery to (LTP induction), removal from (LTD), or recycling within (LTP maintenance) the synapse is determined by the status of phosphorylation and protein binding at specific sites on the tails of AMPA receptor subunits: GluA1 and GluA2. Finally, we relate these to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment, highlighting evidences for LTP as the basis of high-frequency TMS therapy, and briefly touch on the role of plasticity for other brain stimulation modalities. In summary, we present Synaptic Plasticity 101 as a singular introductory reference for those less familiar with the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.},

The {$>$}20-year-old hypothesis that CaMKII stimulation is required for LTP induction, while CaMKII autonomy is required for LTP maintenance was recently supported using the cell-penetrating fusion-peptide inhibitor antCN27. However, we demonstrate here that ant/penetratin fusion to CN27 compromised CaMKII-selectivity, by enhancing a previously unnoticed direct binding of CaM to ant/penetratin. In contrast to antCN27, the improved cell-penetrating inhibitor tatCN21 (5 μm) showed neither CaM binding nor inhibition of basal synaptic transmission. In vitro, tatCN21 inhibited stimulated and autonomous CaMKII activity with equal potency. In rat hippocampal slices, tatCN21 inhibited LTP induction, but not LTP maintenance. Correspondingly, tatCN21 also inhibited learning, but not memory storage or retrieval in a mouse in vivo model. Thus, CaMKII autonomy provides a short-term molecular memory that is important in the signal computation leading to memory formation, but is not required as long-term memory store.},

Here, we provide a comparative analysis of these signaling devices, using single-particle electron microscopy (EM) in combination with biochemical and live-cell imaging studies. In the basal state, both isoforms assemble mainly as 12-mers (but also 14-mers and even 16-mers for the β isoform). CaMKIIα and β isoforms adopt an ensemble of extended activatable states (with average radius of 12.6 versus 16.8 nm, respectively), characterized by multiple transient intra- and inter-holoenzyme interactions associated with distinct functional properties. The extended state of CaMKIIβ allows direct resolution of intra-holoenzyme kinase domain dimers. These dimers could enable cooperative activation by calmodulin, which is observed for both isoforms. High-order CaMKII clustering mediated by inter-holoenzyme kinase domain dimerization is reduced for the β isoform for both basal and excitotoxicity-induced clusters, both in vitro and in neurons., The CaMKII holoenzyme enables neuronal signal computation. In a comparative structure-function analysis of the neuronal α and β isoforms, Buonarati et al. find evidence for kinase domain dimers within the holoenzyme that enable a cooperative activation mechanism in both isoforms and inter-holoenzyme interactions that enable high-order aggregate formation under ischemic conditions.,},

The N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM bind to its target separately but cooperatively and introduce complex dynamics that cannot be well understood by experimental measurement. Using a detailed stochastic model constructed upon experimental data, we have studied the interaction between CaM and Ca2+-CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a key enzyme underlying LTP. The model suggests that the accelerated binding of one lobe of CaM to CaMKII, when the opposing lobe is already bound to CaMKII, is a critical determinant of the cooperative interaction between Ca2+, CaM, and CaMKII. The model indicates that the target-bound Ca2+ free N-lobe has an extended lifetime and may regulate the Ca2+ response of CaMKII during LTP induction. The model also reveals multiple kinetic pathways which have not been previously predicted for CaM-dissociation from CaMKII.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the Cellular Dynamic Simulator (CDS) for simulating diffusion and chemical reactions within crowded molecular environments. CDS is based on a novel event driven algorithm specifically designed for precise calculation of the timing of collisions, reactions and other events for each individual molecule in the environment. Generic mesh based compartments allow the creation / importation of very simple or detailed cellular structures that exist in a 3D environment. Multiple levels of compartments and static obstacles can be used to create a dense environment to mimic cellular boundaries and the intracellular space. The CDS algorithm takes into account volume exclusion and molecular crowding that may impact signaling cascades in small sub-cellular compartments such as dendritic spines. With the CDS, we can simulate simple enzyme reactions; aggregation, channel transport, as well as highly complicated chemical reaction networks of both freely diffusing and membrane bound multi-protein complexes. Components of the CDS are generally defined such that the simulator can be applied to a wide range of environments in terms of scale and level of detail. Through an initialization GUI, a simple simulation environment can be created and populated within minutes yet is powerful enough to design complex 3D cellular architecture. The initialization tool allows visual confirmation of the environment construction prior to execution by the simulator. This paper describes the CDS algorithm, design implementation, and provides an overview of the types of features available and the utility of those features are highlighted in demonstrations.},

  abstract = {We used a particle-based Monte Carlo simulation to dissect the regulatory mechanism of molecular translocation of CaMKII, a key regulator of neuronal synaptic function. Geometry was based upon measurements from EM reconstructions of dendrites in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Three types of simulations were performed to investigate the effects of geometry and other mechanisms that control CaMKII translocation in and out of dendritic spines. First, the diffusional escape rate of CaMKII from model spines of varied morphologies was examined. Second, a postsynaptic density (PSD) was added to study the impact of binding sites on this escape rate. Third, translocation of CaMKII from dendrites and trapping in spines was investigated using a simulated dendrite. Based on diffusion alone, a spine of average dimensions had the ability to retain CaMKII for duration of \textasciitilde 4~s. However, binding sites mimicking those in the PSD controlled the residence time of CaMKII in a highly nonlinear manner. In addition, we observed that F-actin at the spine head/neck junction had a significant impact on CaMKII trapping in dendritic spines. We discuss these results in the context of possible mechanisms that may explain the experimental results that have shown extended accumulation of CaMKII in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity and LTP induction.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often framed as a One Health issue, premised on the interdependence between human, animal and environmental health. Despite this framing, the focus across policymaking, implementation and the ethics of AMR remains anthropocentric in practice, with human health taking priority over the health of non-human animals and the environment, both of which mostly appear as secondary elements to be adjusted to minimise impact on human populations. This perpetuates cross-sectoral asymmetries whereby human health institutions have access to bigger budgets and technical support, limiting the ability of agricultural, animal health or environmental institutions to effectively implement policy initiatives. In this article, we review these asymmetries from an ethical perspective. Through a review and analysis of contemporary literature on the ethics of AMR, we demonstrate how the ethical challenges and tensions raised still emerge from an anthropocentric framing, and argue that such literature fails to address the problematic health hierarchies that underlie policies and ethics of AMR. As a consequence, they fail to provide the necessary tools to ethically evaluate the more-than-human challenges that the long list of actors involved in managing AMR face in their everyday practices. In response to such shortcomings, and to make sense of these challenges and tensions, this article develops an ethical framework based on relationality, care ethics and ambivalence that attends to the more-than-human character of AMR. We formulate this approach without overlooking everyday challenges of implementation by putting the framework in conversation with concrete situations from precarious settings in West Africa. This article concludes by arguing that a useful AMR ethics framework needs to consider and take seriously non-human others as an integral part of both health and disease in any given ecology.},

Similar to common U.S. societal views of Black women, ideological values about Black women’s lives also permeate psychiatry and neuroscience research to prevent likely impactful research that fully examines the role of social power structures in the biological embedding of racism. This article’s overall aim is to highlight the most urgent areas to address in mental health inequities utilizing a Black feminist lens that include 1) culturally grounded and contextually relevant considerations for the biological embedding of racism on mental health outcomes for Black women across the lifespan and 2) intersectional frameworks that address mental health inequities ingrained in multiple marginalization. We conclude with a call to action informed by Black feminist thought for the field of neuroscience to make a concerted effort to address mental health inequities among Black women and other disenfranchised groups from a frame of compassion, cultural humility, and a continuous pursuit of social justice.},

The effects of protein kinase inhibitors on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-mediated, voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC)-mediated, and 100-Hz long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices. 2. A 25-Hz tetanus induced a quickly developing potentiation that was blocked by the NMDA antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and was not affected by the L-type VDCC inhibitor nifedipine, suggesting that it was mediated by NMDA receptors (NMDA-LTP). 3. Application of a 200-Hz tetanus in APV induced a slowly developing NMDA-receptor-independent potentiation that was blocked by nifedipine and thus named VDCC-LTP. NMDA- and VDCC-LTP reached comparable magnitudes despite their different induction parameters and developmental kinetics. 4. Bath perfusion of the broad-spectrum serine/threonine kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) blocked NMDA-LTP but not VDCC-LTP, whereas the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and lavendustin A blocked VDCC-LTP but not NMDA-LTP. These results suggest a differential involvement of H-7-sensitive serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases in the two forms of LTP. 5. Tetanization of 200 Hz in control media resulted in a compound potentiation twice as large as NMDA- or VDCC-LTP, implying that the two forms of LTP did not facilitate or reduce each other's expression. The often-used 100-Hz tetanus (1 s twice) induced a potentiation that was comparable in size with the 200-Hz compound LTP. Nifedipine, genistein, and lavendustin A reduced the 100-Hz LTP by approximately 50\%, suggesting that this LTP is also a compound potentiation consisting of NMDA- and VDCC-mediated components and their corresponding signal transduction pathways.}

Survey responders (response rate 69\%) provided information on unreported outcomes but were often unreliable—for 32\% of those who denied the existence of such outcomes there was evidence to the contrary in their publications. On average, over 20\% of the outcomes measured in a parallel group trial were incompletely reported. Within a trial, such outcomes had a higher odds of being statistically non-significant compared with fully reported outcomes (odds ratio 2.0 (95\% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.7) for efficacy outcomes; 1.9 (1.1 to 3.5) for harm outcomes). The most commonly reported reasons for omitting efficacy outcomes included space constraints, lack of clinical importance, and lack of statistical significance., Conclusions Incomplete reporting of outcomes within published articles of randomised trials is common and is associated with statistical non-significance. The medical literature therefore represents a selective and biased subset of study outcomes, and trial protocols should be made publicly available.},

However, the properties of CaMKII that mediate Ca2+ signals in spines remain elusive. Here, we measured CaMKII activity in spines using fast-framing two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. Following each pulse during repetitive Ca2+ elevations, CaMKII activity increased in a stepwise manner. Thr286 phosphorylation slows the decay of CaMKII and thus lowers the frequency required to induce spine plasticity by several fold. In the absence of Thr286 phosphorylation, increasing the stimulation frequency results in high peak mutant CaMKIIT286A activity that is sufficient for inducing plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that Thr286 phosphorylation plays an important role in induction of LTP by integrating Ca2+ signals, and it greatly promotes, but is dispensable for, the activation of CaMKII and LTP.},

However, the mechanism by which CaMKIIα integrates Ca2+ signals remains elusive. Here, we imaged CaMKIIα-CaM association in single dendritic spines using a new FRET sensor and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. In response to a glutamate uncaging pulse, CaMKIIα-CaM association increases in \textasciitilde 0.1\,s and decays over \textasciitilde 3\,s. During repetitive glutamate uncaging, which induces spine structural plasticity, CaMKIIα-CaM association did not show further increase but sustained at a constant level. Since CaMKIIα activity integrates Ca2+ signals over \textasciitilde 10\,s under this condition, the integration of Ca2+ signal by CaMKIIα during spine structural plasticity is largely due to Ca2+/CaM-independent, autonomous activity. Based on these results, we propose a simple kinetic model of CaMKIIα activation in dendritic spines.},

  abstract = {We live in an age of rapidly advancing genetic research. This research is generating new knowledge that has implications for personal health and well-being. The present study assessed the level of genetic knowledge and personal engagement with genetics in a large sample (N\,=\,5404) of participants. Participants received secondary education in 78 countries, with the largest samples from Russia, the UK and the USA. The results showed significant group differences in genetic knowledge between different countries, professions, education levels and religious affiliations. Overall, genetic knowledge was poor. The questions were designed to assess basic genetic literacy. However, only 1.2\% of participants answered all 18 questions correctly, and the average score was 65.5\%. Genetic knowledge was related to peoples’ attitudes towards genetics. For example, those with greater genetic knowledge were on average more willing to use genetic knowledge for their personal health management. Based on the results, the paper proposes a number of immediate steps that societies can implement to empower the public to benefit from ever-advancing genetic knowledge.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In the mammalian central nervous system, excitatory glutamatergic synapses harness neurotransmission that is mediated by ion flow through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs, which are enriched in the postsynaptic membrane on dendritic spines, are highly dynamic, and shuttle in and out of synapses in an activity-dependent manner. Changes in their number, subunit composition, phosphorylation state, and accessory proteins can all regulate AMPARs and thus modify synaptic strength and support cellular forms of learning. Furthermore, dysregulation of AMPAR plasticity has been implicated in various pathological states and has important consequences for mental health. Here we focus on the mechanisms that control AMPAR plasticity, drawing particularly from the extensive studies on hippocampal synapses, and highlight recent advances in the field along with considerations for future directions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The primate temporal cortex has been demonstrated to play an important role in visual memory and pattern recognition. It is of particular interest to investigate whether activity-dependent modification of synaptic efficacy, a presumptive mechanism for learning and memory, is present in this cortical region. Here we address this issue by examining the induction of synaptic plasticity in surgically resected human inferior and middle temporal cortex. The results show that synaptic strength in the human temporal cortex could undergo bidirectional modifications, depending on the pattern of conditioning stimulation. High frequency stimulation (100 or 40 Hz) in layer IV induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of both intracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials and evoked field potentials in layers II/III. The LTP induced by 100 Hz tetanus was blocked by 50-100 microM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, suggesting that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were responsible for its induction. Long-term depression (LTD) was elicited by prolonged low frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 15 min). It was reduced, but not completely blocked, by DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, implying that some other mechanisms in addition to N-methyl-DL-aspartate receptors were involved in LTD induction. LTD was input-specific, i.e., low frequency stimulation of one pathway produced LTD of synaptic transmission in that pathway only. Finally, the LTP and LTD could reverse each other, suggesting that they can act cooperatively to modify the functional state of cortical network. These results suggest that LTP and LTD are possible mechanisms for the visual memory and pattern recognition functions performed in the human temporal cortex.},

PSDs had a mean diameter of 360 nm and molecular mass of 1.10 ± 0.36 GDa. Because the mass represents the sum of the molecular masses of all of the molecules comprising a PSD, it becomes possible to derive the number of copies of each protein, once its relative mass contribution is known. Mass contributions of PSD-95, synapse-associated protein (SAP)97, and α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were determined by quantitative gel electrophoresis of PSD fractions. The number of PSD-95 molecules per average PSD, contributing 2.3\% of the mass of the PSD, was calculated to be 300, whereas the number of SAP97 molecules, contributing 0.9\% of the mass of the PSD, was 90. The α-CaMKII holoenzymes, which contribute 6\% of the mass when brains are homogenized within 2 min of interrupting blood flow, have 80 holoenzymes associated with a typical PSD. When blood flow is interrupted 15 min before homogenization, the average mass of PSDs increases by ≈40\%. The additional α-CaMKII associated with PSDs accounts for up to 20\% of this mass increase, representing the addition of 100–200 α-CaMKII holoenzymes.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) plays a critical role in long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-established model for learning and memory through the enhancement of synaptic transmission. Biochemical studies indicate that CaMKII catalyzes a phosphotransferase (kinase) reaction of both itself (autophosphorylation) and of multiple downstream target proteins. However, whether either type of phosphorylation plays any role in the synaptic enhancing action of CaMKII remains hotly contested. We have designed a series of experiments to define the minimal requirements for the synaptic enhancement by CaMKII. We find that autophosphorylation of T286 and further binding of CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit are required both for initiating LTP and for its maintenance (synaptic memory). Once bound to the NMDA receptor, the synaptic action of CaMKII occurs in the absence of target protein phosphorylation. Thus, autophosphorylation and binding to the GluN2B subunit are the only two requirements for CaMKII in synaptic memory.},

NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a high affinity binding partner of CaMKII at the postsynaptic membrane. NR2B binds to the T-site of CaMKII and modulates its catalysis. By direct measurement using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that NR2B binding causes about 11 fold increase in the affinity of CaMKII for ATPγS, an analogue of ATP. ITC data is also consistent with an ordered binding mechanism for CaMKII with ATP binding the catalytic site first followed by peptide substrate. We also show that dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr286-α-CaMKII is attenuated when NR2B is bound to CaMKII. This favors the persistence of Thr286 autophosphorylated state of CaMKII in a CaMKII/phosphatase conjugate system in vitro. Overall our data indicate that the NR2B- bound state of CaMKII attains unique biochemical properties which could help in the efficient functioning of the proposed molecular switch supporting synaptic memory.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are small, thin, specialized protrusions from neuronal dendrites, primarily localized in the excitatory synapses. Sophisticated imaging techniques revealed that dendritic spines are complex structures consisting of a dense network of cytoskeletal, transmembrane and scaffolding molecules, and numerous surface receptors. Molecular signaling pathways, mainly Rho and Ras family small GTPases pathways that converge on actin cytoskeleton, regulate the spine morphology and dynamics bi-directionally during synaptic activity. During synaptic plasticity the number and shapes of dendritic spines undergo radical reorganizations. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induction promote spine head enlargement and the formation and stabilization of new spines. Long-term depression (LTD) results in their shrinkage and retraction. Reports indicate increased spine density in the pyramidal neurons of autism and Fragile X syndrome patients and reduced density in the temporal gyrus loci of schizophrenic patients. Post-mortem reports of Alzheimer’s brains showed reduced spine number in the hippocampus and cortex. This review highlights the spine morphogenesis process, the activity-dependent structural plasticity and mechanisms by which synaptic activity sculpts the dendritic spines, the structural and functional changes in spines during learning and memory using LTP and LTD processes. It also discusses on spine status in neurodegenerative diseases and the impact of nootropics and neuroprotective agents on the functional restoration of dendritic spines.},

  abstract = {AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), as well as most other transmembrane proteins, are not stable in the postsynaptic density as was previously thought, but undergo constant trafficking in and out of synapses by a combination of endo/exocytosis and lateral diffusion. The respective contributions of membrane recycling events and surface trafficking to setting AMPAR numbers at synapses have been the subject of intense debate. Although this discussion is not yet settled, it is safe to state that both categories of processes participate in receptor exchange at synapses at rest and during various forms of plasticity. More unexpectedly, AMPARs can diffuse at such high rates within the postsynaptic density itself that their surface trafficking could participate not only in setting receptor numbers at individual synapses but also in tuning synaptic transmission during short-term plasticity. I here review recent results that characterize the activity-dependent properties of AMPAR surface trafficking and their possible links to fast synaptic transmission.},

We have cloned a member of a novel class of the rat ionotropic glutamate receptor family, termed chi-1. This subunit exhibits an average identity of 27\% to NMDA subunits and 23\% to non-NMDA subunits. Regional transcript levels of chi-1 are elevated just prior to and during the first postnatal week, with the highest levels present in the spinal cord, brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, CA1 field of the hippocampus, and amygdala. The spatial distribution of chi-1 expression is similar from postnatal day 1 (P1) to adulthood. However, transcript levels decline sharply between P7 and P14 and remain attenuated into adulthood. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed chi-1 RNA did not demonstrate agonist-activated currents. Pairwise expression of chi-1 with members of the AMPA, KA, or delta class of glutamate recepto subunits either failed to generate agonist-activated currents or failed to alter the underlying current generated by the coexpressed subunit. However, coexpression of chi-1 with subunits forming otherwise functional NMDA receptors resulted in an inhibition of current responses. Since chi-1 did not alter the currents generated by non-NMDA subunits, this suggests that chi-1 may specifically interact with NMDA receptor subunits. Further characterization will be required to establish the precise role of this glutamate receptor subunit in neuronal signaling.},

  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Shekarro et al., 2021) that usually surfaces early and creates lifelong difficulties in social relations and communications, and rigid and repetitive patterns of behaviors (Axelrod et al., 2012). Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) has long been considered the gold standard of treatment for those that meet the ASD criteria (McPhilemy \& Dillenburger, 2013). However, a number of critiques of ABA have been raised by those claiming that ABA is ‘ableistic.’ These have included the idea that the use of ABA promotes dependence, erodes the sense of self and uniqueness by shaming participants for aspects of autism and forcing a need to be like neurotypical peers. In addition, critics claim that ABA creates emotional detachment, resentment, and a decrease in a sense of community, and increases the likelihood of mental health issues. Finally, ABA critics argue that ABA does not address helping the non-speaking individuals on the autism spectrum. In contrast, several meta-analytic reviews have debunked this notion (e.g., Wolff et al., 2022). These find strong evidence supporting the efficacy of ABA with non-speaking clients on the autism spectrum. In contrast, the ableism literature focuses primarily on case reports and qualitative analyses and does not include non-speaking individuals on the autism spectrum in their research. In response to the complaints about being ‘forced’ to be like neurotypical peers, I argue that those complaining fail to understand the connections between the impact of ABA on social behaviors and communication, and their very ability to speak out about what they do not like. It is illogical to ask children who are not fully cognitively developed to provide their input on treatment. I argue that autistic individuals are ultimately asking for social change. They are asking their neuro-typical peers to see outside of their autistic differences and be welcomed for who they are as an individual. Until that is achieved, the improvements made in ABA therapy will continue to be seen in a negative light.},

Commun. 173, 578-584) with EGTA, magnesium acetate, and [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the incorporation of up to 1.0 mol of 32PO4/mol of subunit within 60 min at 30 degrees C; both serine and threonine residues became autophosphorylated. The Vmax for this basal autophosphorylation was 0.051 +/- 0.005 mol of 32PO4/mol of subunit/min, and the Km(ATP) was 145 +/- 8 microM. Vmax and Km(ATP) values for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation were determined to be 1.3 +/- 0.4 mol/mol/min and 19 +/- 2 microM, respectively. Basal autophosphorylation resulted in inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity toward exogenous peptide substrate; there was no measurable increase in Ca(2+)-independent CaMKII activity. Inactivation was not observed following preincubation with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs in place of ATP. CaMKII that had been inactivated by basal autophosphorylation could be fully re-activated by incubation with the purified catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Following basal autophosphorylation, the calmodulin-binding ability of CaMKII was also reduced, presumably accounting for the observed inactivation. Both the inactivation and the decrease in calmodulin-binding that resulted from basal autophosphorylation were abrogated by mutation of threonine 306 to alanine, but not by mutation of threonine 305 to alanine. Furthermore, mutation of threonine 306, but not threonine 305, to alanine reduced the extent of basal autophosphorylation at threonine residues. Thus, basal autophosphorylation at threonine 306 blocks calmodulin binding, resulting in inactivation of CaMKII.},

  abstract = {1. The effects of excitatory amino acids and some antagonists applied by ionophoresis to stratum radiatum in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices were examined on the locally recorded field e.p.s.p. evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural projection. 2. L-glutamate, L-aspartate and the more potent and selective excitatory amino acids quisqualate, kainate and N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMA) depressed the e.p.s.p., presumably through depolarization and/or a change in membrane conductance. 3. The depression induced by kainate considerably outlasted the period of ejection whereas NMA depressions were rapidly reversible and were often followed by a potentiation of the e.p.s.p. In higher doses NMA also depressed the presynaptic fibre volley. The possible involvement of these effects in neurotoxicity and synaptic plasticity is raised. 4. The selective NMA antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) applied in doses which abolished responses to NMA, had no effect on the e.p.s.p. but prevented long term potentiation (l.t.p.) of synaptic transmission evoked by high frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. Other antagonists which had little or no effect on normal synaptic transmission included D-alpha-aminoadipate (DAA), the optical isomers of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) and L-glutamate diethylester (GDEE). 5. In contrast, gamma-D-glutamylglycine (DGG), applied in amounts which affected quisqualate and kainate actions as well as those of NMA, was an effective synaptic antagonist whilst having no effect on the presynaptic fibre volley. 6. These results indicate that the synaptic receptor in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway may be of the kainate or quisqualate type. Although NMA receptors do not appear to be involved in normal synaptic transmission in this pathway they may play a role in synaptic plasticity. The interaction of L-glutamate and L-aspartate with these receptors is discussed.},

NMDAR-dependent LTD prevails in juvenile mice, but a mechanistically different form of LTD can be readily induced in adults by instead stimulating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). However, the role that CaMKII plays in the mGluR-dependent form of LTD is not clear. Here we show that mGluR-dependent LTD also requires CaMKII and its T286 autophosphorylation (pT286), which induces Ca2+-independent autonomous kinase activity. In addition, we compared the role of pT286 among three forms of long-term plasticity (NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD, and mGluR-dependent LTD) using simultaneous live imaging of endogenous CaMKII together with synaptic marker proteins. We determined that after LTP stimuli, pT286 autophosphorylation accelerated CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. After NMDAR-LTD stimuli, pT286 was strictly required for any movement to inhibitory synapses. Similar to NMDAR-LTD, we found the mGluR-LTD stimuli did not induce CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. However, in contrast to NMDAR-LTD, we demonstrate that the mGluR-LTD did not involve CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses and did not require additional T305/306 autophosphorylation. Thus, despite its prominent role in LTP, we conclude that CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation is also required for both major forms of hippocampal LTD, albeit with differential requirements for the heterosynaptic communication of excitatory signals to inhibitory synapses.},

A requirement for T286 autophosphorylation also for efficient Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity has been described, but remains controversial. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to determine the contribution of T286 autophosphorylation to Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity, the activity of CaMKII wild type and its phosphorylation-incompetent T286A mutant was compared. As the absolute activity can vary between individual kinase preparations, the activity was measured in six different extracts for each kinase (expressed in HEK-293 cells). Consistent with measurements on purified kinase (from a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system), CaMKII T286A showed a mildly but significantly reduced rate of Ca2+/CaM-stimulated phosphorylation for two different peptide substrates (to ∼75–84\% of wild type). Additional slower CaMKII autophosphorylation at T305/306 inhibits stimulation by Ca2+/CaM, but occurs only minimally for CaMKII wild type during CaM-stimulated activity assays. Thus, we tested if the T286A mutant may show more extensive inhibitory autophosphorylation, which could explain its reduced stimulated activity. By contrast, inhibitory autophosphorylation was instead found to be even further reduced for the T286A mutant under our assay conditions. On a side note, the phospho-T305 antibody showed some basal background immuno-reactivity also with non-phosphorylated CaMKII, as indicated by T305/306A mutants. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that Ca2+/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity is mildly (∼1.2–1.3fold) further increased by additional T286 autophosphorylation, but that this autophosphorylation is not required for the major part of the stimulated activity. This indicates that the phenotype of CaMKII T286A mutant mice is indeed due to the lack of autonomous activity, as the T286A mutant showed no dramatic reduction in stimulated activity.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Both signaling by nitric oxide (NO) and by the Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II α isoform (CaMKIIα) are implicated in two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, as well as in excitotoxic/ischemic neuronal cell death. For CaMKIIα, these functions specifically involve also Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-independent autonomous activity, traditionally generated by Thr-286 autophosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that NO-induced \emph{S}-nitrosylation of CaMKIIα also directly generated autonomous activity, and that CaMKII inhibition protected from NO-induced neuronal cell death. NO induced \emph{S}-nitrosylation at Cys-280/289, and mutation of either site abolished autonomy, indicating that simultaneous nitrosylation at both sites was required. Additionally, autonomy was generated only when Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/CaM was present during NO exposure. Thus, generation of this form of CaMKIIα autonomy requires simultaneous signaling by NO and Ca\textsuperscript{2+}. Nitrosylation also significantly reduced subsequent CaMKIIα autophosphorylation specifically at Thr-286, but not at Thr-305. A previously described reduction of CaMKII activity by \emph{S}-nitrosylation at Cys-6 was also observed here, but only after prolonged ({$>$}5 min) exposure to NO donors. These results demonstrate a novel regulation of CaMKII by another second messenger system and indicate its involvement in excitotoxic neuronal cell death.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4–7 Hz) can contribute to memory formation by separating encoding (storage) and retrieval of memories into different functional half-cycles (Hasselmo et al. (2002) Neural Comput 14:793–817). We investigate, via computer simulations, the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal input patterns are achieved by the CA1 microcircuitry. A model of the CA1 microcircuit is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major cell types, including pyramidal (P) cells and four types of inhibitory interneurons: basket (B) cells, axo-axonic (AA) cells, bistratified (BS) cells and oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells. Inputs to the network come from the entorhinal cortex (EC), the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and medial septum. The EC input provides the sensory information, whereas all other inputs provide context and timing information. Septal input provides timing information for phasing storage and recall. Storage is accomplished via a local STDP mediated hetero-association of the EC input pattern and the incoming CA3 input pattern on the CA1 pyramidal cell target synapses. The model simulates the timing of firing of different hippocampal cell types relative to the theta rhythm in anesthetized animals and proposes experimentally confirmed functional roles for the different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the storage and recall cycles (Klausberger et al., (2003, 2004) Nature 421:844–848, Nat Neurosci 7:41–47). Measures of recall performance of new and previously stored input patterns in the presence or absence of various inhibitory interneurons are employed to quantitatively test the performance of our model. Finally, the mean recall quality of the CA1 microcircuit is tested as the number of stored patterns is increased. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Inequalities are reflected in the data collected for scientific purposes. When not properly accounted for, machine learning (ML) models leart from data can reinforce these structural inequalities or biases. Here, we present a systematic study of bias in ML models designed to predict depression in four different case studies covering different countries and populations. We find that standard ML approaches show regularly biased behaviors. We also show that mitigation techniques, both standard and our own post-hoc method, can be effective in reducing the level of unfair bias. No single best ML model for depression prediction provides equality of outcomes. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing fairness during model selection and transparent reporting about the impact of debiasing interventions. Finally, we provide practical recommendations to develop bias-aware ML models for depression risk prediction.},

It is enriched at the post-synaptic density (PSD), a localization which is thought to be critical for many of its proposed neuronal functions. In order to better understand the mechanisms that regulate association of CaMKII with the PSD, we compared the levels of autophosphorylation between PSD-associated kinase and kinase in other parts of the neuron. We were surprised to find that αCaMKII in a PSD-enriched fraction prepared from recovered hippocampal CA1-minislices had a relatively low level of threonine 286 (T286) phosphorylation and a relatively high level of threonine 305 (T305) phosphorylation. Furthermore, when the minislices were subjected to a treatment that mimics ischemic conditions, there was a significant translocation of αCaMKII to the PSD-enriched fraction accompanied with a dramatic reduction in T286 phosphorylation levels throughout the neuron. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of autophosphorylation in the localization of CaMKII.},

This scoping review aimed to identify actionable guidance for those closely involved in AI-based prediction model (AIPM) development, evaluation and implementation including software engineers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals and to identify potential gaps in this guidance. We performed a scoping review of the relevant literature providing guidance or quality criteria regarding the development, evaluation, and implementation of AIPMs using a comprehensive multi-stage screening strategy. PubMed, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library were searched, and AI experts were consulted. Topics were extracted from the identified literature and summarized across the six phases at the core of this review: (1) data preparation, (2) AIPM development, (3) AIPM validation, (4) software development, (5) AIPM impact assessment, and (6) AIPM implementation into daily healthcare practice. From 2683 unique hits, 72 relevant guidance documents were identified. Substantial guidance was found for data preparation, AIPM development and AIPM validation (phases 1–3), while later phases clearly have received less attention (software development, impact assessment and implementation) in the scientific literature. The six phases of the AIPM development, evaluation and implementation cycle provide a framework for responsible introduction of AI-based prediction models in healthcare. Additional domain and technology specific research may be necessary and more practical experience with implementing AIPMs is needed to support further guidance.},

Although information is thought to be encoded in the frequency of such oscillations, no frequency decoder has been identified. Rapid superfusion of immobilized Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in vitro showed that the enzyme can decode the frequency of Ca2+ spikes into distinct amounts of kinase activity. The frequency response of CaM kinase II was modulated by several factors, including the amplitude and duration of individual spikes as well as the subunit composition and previous state of activation of the kinase. These features should provide specificity in the activation of this multifunctional enzyme by distinct cellular stimuli and may underlie its pivotal role in activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.}

In vitro ACh induced a Ca2+ wave and synaptic enhancement mediated by insertion of AMPA receptors in spines. Activation of muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) and Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive stores were required for this synaptic enhancement that was insensitive to blockade of NMDA receptors and also triggered by IP3 uncaging. Activation of cholinergic afferents in vivo induced an analogous atropine-sensitive synaptic enhancement. We describe a novel form of synaptic enhancement (LTPIP3) that is induced in vitro and in vivo by activation of mAChRs.

Follow-up, by 1988 interview with the principal investigator or surrogate, of all clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1979, to learn of trial results and publication status. Two hundred ninety-three NIH trials, funded in 1979. Publication of clinical trial results. Of the 198 clinical trials completed by 1988, 93\% had been published. Trials with "significant" results were more likely to be published than those showing "nonsignificant" results (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 12.30; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.54 to 60.00). No other factor was positively associated with publication. Most unpublished trials remained so because investigators thought the results were "not interesting" or they "did not have enough time" (42.8\%). Metaanalysis using data from this and 3 similar studies provided a combined unadjusted OR of 2.88 (95\% CI, 2.13 to 3.89) for the association between significant results and publication. Even when the overall publication rate is high, such as for trials funded by the NIH, publication bias remains a significant problem. Given the importance of trials and their utility in evaluating medical treatments, especially within the context of metaanalysis, it is clear that we need more reliable systems for maintaining information about initiated studies. Trial registers represent such a system but must receive increased financial support to succeed.},

Unfortunately, an acculturation process to racism and sexism has been occurring for generations leading to systemic inequities that will take a long time to disappear. Here, we highlight the existence of current examples of racism, Western-centrism and sexism within: (1) the most popular anatomical atlases used in biological, anthropological and medical education; (2) prominent natural history museums and World Heritage Sites; (3) biological and anthropological scientific research publications; and (4) popular culture and influential children's books and educational materials concerning human biology and evolution.},

Many insights into how genetic changes impact protein function can be gleaned if three-dimensional structures of the associated proteins are available. The availability of a highly accurate method of predicting structures from amino acid sequences (e.g. Alphafold2) is thus potentially a great boost to those wanting to understand genetic changes. In this paper we discuss the current state of protein structures known for the human and other proteomes and how Alphafold2 might impact on variant interpretation efforts. For the human proteome in particular, the state of the available structural data suggests that the impact on variant interpretation might be less than anticipated. We also discuss additional efforts in structure prediction that could further aid the understanding of genetic variants.},

Taking stock of a long-term empirical evidence on the pharmaceutical sector in the US, we can hardly support IPRs intended as an innovation rewarding institution. According to our analysis, pharma patents have constituted legal barriers to protect intellectual monopolies rather than an incentive and a reward to innovative efforts. Patenting strategies appear to be quite aggressive in extending knowledge borders and enlarging the space protected from the possibility of infringement. This is also witnessed by the fact that patent applications are very skewed in the covered trade names and patent thickness expands over time. Conversely, the ratio of patents protecting new drugs approved by the FDA which draw upon government-sponsored research – as such, a mark for quality – falls. Firm-level analysis on profitability confirms strong correlation, restricted to publicly traded pharmaceutical companies, between patent portfolio and profit margins.},

  abstract = {The discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long-term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP-memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.},

Each of the five dimensions is important not only because it addresses an aspect of good research done in a good manner, but also because it addresses the concerns of key stakeholders in the research enterprise. The five-dimension framework can guide institutions as they answer three questions central to any research ethics program: (1) Who should champion research ethics?, (2) What should interventions look like?, and (3) Who should participate in the interventions? The framework is valuable because the answers to these three questions are radically different depending upon the dimension under consideration. An expanded vision of research ethics does not entail that institutions should require additional online training or approvals from institutional review boards. However, without acknowledging all five dimensions, programs risk missing an important aspect of research ethics or ignoring the interests of important stakeholders.},

We propose a simple biophysical model for the activation of CaMKII by Ca2+ and calmodulin. The model describes the transition of the subunits of the kinase between their different possible states (inactive, bound to Ca2+–CaM, phosphorylated at Thr286, trapped and autonomous). All transitions are described by classical kinetic equations except for the autophosphorylation step, which is modeled in an empirical manner. The model quantitatively reproduces the experimentally demonstrated frequency sensitivity of CaMKII [Science 279 (1998) 227]. We further use the model to investigate the role of several characterized features of the kinase—as well as some that are not easily attainable by experiments—in its frequency-dependent responses. In cellular microdomains, CaMKII is expected to sense very brief Ca2+ spikes; our simulations under such conditions reveal that the enzyme response is tuned to optimal frequencies. This prediction is then confirmed by experimental data. This novel and simple model should help in understanding the rules that govern CaMKII regulation, as well as those involved in decoding intracellular Ca2+ signals.},

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the tension between open science and data protection requirements. Researchers are left pondering how best to comply with the different jurisdictional requirements of anonymization, pseudonymisation or de-identification without compromising the scientific utility of neuroimages even further. In this paper, we present perspectives intended to clarify the meaning and scope of these concepts and highlight the privacy limitations of available pseudonymisation and de-identification techniques.

  abstract = {The distribution of type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been mapped in rat brain by immunochemical and immunohistochemical methods using an antibody against its alpha-subunit. The concentration of the kinase, measured by radioimmunoassay, varies markedly in different brain regions. It is most highly concentrated in the telencephalon where it comprises approximately 2\% of the total hippocampal protein, 1.3\% of cortical protein, and 0.7\% of striatal protein. It is less concentrated in lower brain structures, ranging from about 0.3\% of hypothalamic protein to 0.1\% of protein in the pons/medulla. The gradient of staining intensity observed in brain sections by immunohistochemistry corroborates this distribution. Neurons and neuropil of the hippocampus are densely stained, whereas little staining is observed in lower brain regions such as the superior colliculus. Within the diencephalon and midbrain, dense staining is observed only in thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra. The skewed distribution of alpha-subunit appears to be due in part to the occurrence in the cerebellum and pons/medulla of forms of the kinase with a high ratio of beta- to alpha-subunits. However, most of the variation is due to the extremely high concentration of the kinase in particular neurons, especially those of the hippocampus, cortex and striatum. The unusually high expression of the kinase in these neurons is likely to confer upon them specialized responses to calcium ion that are different from those of neurons in lower brain regions.},

We have analysed the impact of a representative set of features and algorithms and highlighted the problems inherent in generating reliable protein data sets and in the posterior analysis of the results. Although it is clear that there have been some improvements in methods for predicting interacting sites, several major bottlenecks remain. Proteins in complexes are still under-represented in the structural databases and in particular many proteins involved in transient complexes are still to be crystallized. We provide suggestions for effective feature selection, and make it clear that community standards for testing, training and performance measures are necessary for progress in the field.},

The consequences of protein-protein interactions are difficult to specify and track with a conventional modeling approach because of the large number of protein phosphoforms and protein complexes that these interactions potentially generate. Here, we focus on how a rule-based model is specified in the BioNetGen language (BNGL) and how a model specification is analyzed using the BioNetGen software tool. We also discuss new developments in rule-based modeling that should enable the construction and analyses of comprehensive models for signal transduction pathways and similarly large-scale models for other biochemical systems.},

A prototypic exocrine cell, the acid secreting gastric parietal cell, largely redistributes its cytoplasmic tubulocisternal membranes (TC) to the secretory apical membrane (SA) after stimulation. We here present a dependence of physiological response on partitioned initial CaMKII activities redistributed between TC and SA. Initial acid secretion after cholinergic stimulation has doubled if activities of phosphatases PP1/PP2A and protein kinase PKC-alpha were inhibited by the inhibitors calyculin A and Gö 6976. CaMKII appears to be integrated in multienzyme complexes each specific for TC and SA. Therein, PP1/PP2A and PKC-alpha were found to permanently counteract initial CaMKII activities in different modes of transregulation. Remarkably, a dys-transregulated, hyperactive CaMKII at TC did not result in an increased acid secretion to the same extent. A simple mathematical model to estimate the share of TC- and SA-associated CaMKII activities in cholinergically induced acid secretion suggests that TC-associated CaMKII appears to autoregulate its contribution to the physiological response by a negative feedback control. Subcellular distribution and stimulus-dependent redistribution of domain-associated CaMKII signalosomes indicate a fine balanced, adaptive system to guarantee a stable physiological response.},

Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report “negative” results (results that fail to support the tested hypothesis). Therefore, if publication pressures increase scientific bias, the frequency of “positive” results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and “productive” academic environments. This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US. Across all disciplines, papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that, according to NSF data, produced more academic papers per capita. The size of this effect increased when controlling for state's per capita R\&D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results, including discipline and methodology. Although the confounding effect of institutions' prestige could not be excluded (researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments), these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists' productivity but also their bias. The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high.},

Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes all have biological properties that could influence learning and cognition. Myelination by oligodendrocytes increases conduction velocity, affecting spike timing and oscillations in neuronal activity. Astrocytes can modulate synaptic transmission and may couple multiple neurons and synapses into functional assemblies. Microglia can remove synapses in an activity-dependent manner altering neural networks. Incorporating glia into a bicellular mechanism of nervous system function may help answer long-standing questions concerning the cellular mechanisms of learning and cognition.},

  abstract = {NEUROTROPHINS promote neuronal survival and differentiation, but the fact that their expression is modified by neuronal activity, suggests a role in regulating synapse development and plasticity1–3. In developing hippocampus, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB4–7 increases in parallel with the ability to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP)8–10. Here we report a mechanism by which BDNF modulates hippocampal LTP. Exogenous BDNF promoted the induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation in young (postnatal day 12–13) hippocampal slices, which in the absence of BDNF show only short-term potentiation (STP). This effect was due to an enhanced ability of hippocampal synapses to respond to tetanic stimulation, rather than to a direct modulation of the LTP-triggering mechanism. A TrkB–IgG fusion protein, which scavenges endogenous BDNF11, reduced the synaptic responses to tetanus as well as the magnitude of LTP in adult hippocampus. Our results suggest that BDNF may regulate LTP in developing and adult hippocampus by enhancing synaptic responses to tetanic stimulation.},

The phenomenon of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is viewed by many as a putative mechanism of memory storage and has proved a most valuable model for study of neuronal plasticity at the cellular level. The present study was conducted to investigate the possibility that stressful events which occur prior (in vivo) to the preparation of brain slices may influence the electrophysiology of the in vitro hippocampal explant when tested for LTP. Adult male rats (Long-Evans male × Sprague-Dawley female) were pair-housed 1 week prior to testing. One animal in each pair was either placed in a restraining tube for 30 min and received no tail shocks (Restraint) or placed in a restraining tube and received tail shocks (1 μA, 1 s) every minute for 30 min (Restraint + Shock). The other animal in each pair was taken directly from the home cage and received no restraint or tail shock (Control). In vitro hippocampal slices were then prepared immediately from these animals according to standard methods. Our results demonstrate a marked impairment of LTP in hippocampal explants taken from rats exposed to stress. The significance of this result with respect to cellular mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress, cognition, and learning is discussed.},

In 2019, 29 Mt of plastic waste was collected in Europe. It is estimated that 32\% was recycled, 43\% was incinerated and 25\% was sent to landfill. It has been estimated that life-sciences (biology, medicine, etc.) alone create plastic waste of approximately 5.5 Mt/yr, the majority being disposed of by incineration. The vast majority of this plastic waste is made from fossil fuel sources, though there is a growing interest in the possible use of bioplastics as a viable alternative for single-use lab consumables, such as petri dishes, pipette tips, etc. However, to-date only limited bioplastic replacement examples exist. In this review, common polymers used for labware are discussed, along with examining the possibility of replacing these materials with bioplastics, specifically polylactic acid (PLA). The material properties of PLA are described, along with possible functional improvements dure to additives. Finally, the standards and benchmarks needed for assessing bioplastics produced for labware components are reviewed.},

  abstract = {Repeated stimulation of hippocampal neurons can induce an immediate and prolonged increase in synaptic strength that is called long-term potentiation (LTP)—the primary cellular model of memory in the mammalian brain1. An early phase of LTP (lasting less than three hours) can be dissociated from late-phase LTP by using inhibitors of transcription and translation2–8. Because protein synthesis occurs mainly in the cell body9–12, whereas LTP is input-specific, the question arises of how the synapse specificity of late LTP is achieved without elaborate intracellular protein trafficking. We propose that LTP initiates the creation of a short-lasting protein-synthesis-independent 'synaptic tag' at the potentiated synapse which sequesters the relevant protein(s) to establish late LTP. In support of this idea, we now show that weak tetanic stimulation, which ordinarily leads only to early LTP, or repeated tetanization in the presence of protein-synthesis inhibitors, each results in protein-synthesis-dependent late LTP, provided repeated tetanization has already been applied at another input to the same population of neurons. The synaptic tag decays in less than three hours. These findings indicate that the persistence of LTP depends not only on local events during its induction, but also on the prior activity of the neuron.},

As the ability to peer directly into the brain is scientifically honed, and conscious states can be correlated with patterns of neural processing, an easy—but premature—leap is to postulate a one-way, brain-based determinism. That leap is problematic, however, and emerging findings in neuroscience can even be seen as compatible with some of the basic tenets of existentialism. Given the compelling authority of modern “science,” it is especially important to question how the findings of neuroscience are framed, and how the articulation of research results challenge or change individuals’ perceptions of themselves. Context plays an essential role in the emergence of human identity and in the sculpting of the human brain; for example, even a lack of stimuli (“nothing”) can lead to substantial consequences for brain, behavior, and experience. Conversely, advances in understanding the brain might contribute to more precise definitions of what it means to be human, including definitions of appropriate social and moral behavior. Put another way, the issue is not simply the ethics involved in framing neurotechnology, but also the incorporation of neuroscientific findings into a richer understanding of human ethical (and existential) functioning.},

When 10 μM ACPD was applied in the presence of test inputs, co-application of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, d,l-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate resulted in LTD induction when used at 50 μM. In ACPD-induced LTP, the delivery of test synaptic inputs to CA1 neurons could be replaced by co-application of NMDA (100 nM) during ACPD perfusion. These results suggest that, in CA1 neurons, a co-operative effect involving the activation of both mGluRs and NMDA receptors is required to trigger the process involved in ACPD-induced LTP. In addition, ACPD-induced LTD was blocked by co-application of an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor inhibitor, 2-aminotheoxydiphenyl borate (10 μM), which had no effect on ACPD-induced LTP. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate that ACPD-induced LTP involves NMDA receptors, but not IP3 receptors, whereas the converse applies to ACPD-induced LTD.},

  abstract = {The observation that autophosphorylation converts CaM kinase II from the Ca2+-dependent form to the Ca2+-independent form has led to speculation that the formation of the Ca2+-independent form of the enzyme could encode frequency of synaptic usage and serve as a molecular explanation of “memory”. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, glutamate elevated the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II through autophosphorylation, and this response was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist, d-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). In addition, we confirmed that high, but not low frequency stimulation, applied to two groups of CA1 afferents in the rat hippocampus, resulted in LTP induction with concomitant long-lasting increases in Ca2+-independent and total activities of CaM kinase II. In experiments with 32P-labeled hippocampal slices, the LTP induction in the CA1 region was associated with increases in autophosphorylation of both α and β subunits of CaM kinase II 1 h after LTP induction. Significant increases in phosphorylation of endogenous CaM kinase II substrates, synapsin I and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which are originally located in presynaptic and postsynaptic regions, respectively, were also observed in the same slice. All these changes were prevented when high frequency stimulation was applied in the presence of AP5 or a calmodulin antagonist, calmidazolium. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor by CaM kinase II was reported in the postsynaptic density and infusion of the constitutively active CaM kinase II into the hippocampal neurons enhanced kainate-induced response. These results support the idea that CaM kinase II contributes to the induction of hippocampal LTP in both postsynaptic and presynaptic regions through phosphorylation of target proteins such as the AMPA receptor, MAP2 and synapsin I.

We have documented the three-dimensional structures and the biophysical and enzymatic properties of the four gene products. Biophysical analyses showed that each isoform assembles into oligomeric forms and their three-dimensional structures at 21–25 Å revealed that all four isoforms were dodecamers with similar but highly unusual architecture. A gear-shaped core comprising the association domain has the catalytic domains tethered on appendages, six of which extend from both ends of the core. At this level of resolution, we can discern no isoform-dependent differences in ultrastructure of the holoenzymes. Enzymatic analyses showed that the isoforms were similar in their \emph{K\textsubscript{m}} for ATP and the peptide substrate syntide, but showed significant differences in their interactions with Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-calmodulin as assessed by binding, substrate phosphorylation, and autophosphorylation. Interestingly, the rank order of CaM binding affinity (γ {$>$} β {$>$} δ {$>$} α) does not directly correlate with the rank order of their CaM dependence for autophosphorylation (β {$>$} γ {$>$} δ {$>$} α).

Here, we report that LTP and LTD in the hippocampal CA1 region of freely moving adult rats were prevented by NMDAR 2A (GluN2A) and 2B subunit (GluN2B) preferential antagonists, respectively. These results strongly suggest that NMDAR subtype preferential antagonists are appropriate tools to probe the roles of LTP and LTD in spatial memory. Using a Morris water maze task, the LTP-blocking GluN2A antagonist had no significant effect on any aspect of performance, whereas the LTD-blocking GluN2B antagonist impaired spatial memory consolidation. Moreover, similar spatial memory deficits were induced by inhibiting the expression of LTD with intrahippocampal infusion of a short peptide that specifically interferes with AMPA receptor endocytosis. Taken together, our findings support a functional requirement of hippocampal CA1 LTD in the consolidation of long-term spatial memory.},

Regulation of this interaction is well-studied biochemically, but not under conditions that mimic the macromolecular crowding found within cells. Notably, previous molecular crowding experiments with lysozyme indicated an effect on the CaMKII holoenzyme conformation. Here, we found that the effect of molecular crowding on Ca2+/CaM-induced CaMKII binding to immobilized GluN2B in vitro depended on the specific crowding reagent. While binding was reduced by lysozyme, it was enhanced by BSA. The ATP content in the BSA preparation caused CaMKII autophosphorylation at T286 during the binding reaction; however, enhanced binding was also observed when autophosphorylation was blocked. Importantly, the positive regulation by nucleotide and BSA (as well as other macromolecular crowding reagents) did not alleviate the requirement for CaMKII stimulation to induce GluN2B binding. The differential effect of lysozyme (14 kDa) and BSA (66 kDa) was not due to size difference, as both dextran-10 and dextran-70 enhanced binding. By contrast, crowding with immunoglobulin G (IgG) reduced binding. Notably, lysozyme and IgG but not BSA directly bound to Ca2+/CaM in an overlay assay, suggesting a competition of lysozyme and IgG with the Ca2+/CaM-stimulus that induces CaMKII/GluN2B binding. However, lysozyme negatively regulated binding even when it was instead induced by CaMKII T286 phosphorylation. Alternative modes of competition would be with CaMKII or GluN2B, and the negative effects of lysozyme and IgG indeed also correlated with specific or non-specific binding to the immobilized GluN2B. Thus, the effect of any specific crowding reagent can differ, depending on its additional direct effects on CaMKII/GluN2B binding. However, the results of this study also indicate that, in principle, macromolecular crowding enhances CaMKII binding to GluN2B.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is thought to be an important cellular mechanism underlying memory formation. A widely accepted model posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.},

This is the first study to explore how this is achieved in relation to their participation in implementing refinement and reduction, two of the three key guiding ethical principles--the "3Rs"--of what is deemed to be humane animal experimentation. The interpretative approach contributes to emerging work within the social sciences and humanities exploring care and ethics in practice. Based on qualitative analysis of participant observation within animal research facilities in UK universities, in-depth interviews with ATs, facility managers, and other stakeholders, and analysis of regulatory guidelines, we draw a contrast between the minimum required of ATs by law and how their care work not only meets but often exceeds these requirements. We outline how ATs constitute a key source of innovation and insight into the refinement of animal care and the reduction of animal use, hitherto not formally acknowledged. Exploring AT care work as an example of ethics in practice makes an original contribution to broader debates within health care and animal welfare about how technology, regulation, and behavior can foster and sustain a "culture of care".},

  abstract = {Whole cell/patch-clamp and extracellular field potential recordings were used to study the induction and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor independent long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of the in vitro rat hippocampus. Induction of NMDA receptor independent LTP was prevented by manipulations that inhibited postsynaptic depolarization during tetanic stimulation: direct hyperpolarization of postsynaptic neurons and bath application of an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor antagonist. NMDA receptor independent LTP also was blocked by intracellular application of the lidocaine derivative, N-(2,6-dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl)triethylammonium bromide (QX-314), to CA1 pyramidal neurons. These results complement the previous findings that NMDA receptor independent LTP was inhibited by postsynaptic injections of the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and also was inhibited by a L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist (nifedipine). Collectively, these data make a strong case for the postsynaptic induction of this form of LTP. This paper also provides evidence for postsynaptic expression of NMDA receptor independent LTP. In an experiment where AMPA- and NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were isolated pharmacologically, LTP was found for only the AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSPs. In a separate experiment, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was measured during NMDA receptor independent LTP. Although there was an initial decrease in PPF, suggesting a posttetanic increase in the probability of glutamate release, the change in PPF decayed within 30-40 min of the tetanic stimulation, whereas the magnitude of the LTP was constant over this same time period. In addition, the LTP, but not the corresponding change in PPF, was blocked by the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (+/-)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. These results are accounted for most easily by a selective increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptor function, but one type of presynaptic modification-an increase in the number of release sites without an overall change in the probability of release-also could account for these results (assuming that the level of glutamate release before LTP induction fully saturated NMDA, but not AMPA, receptors). One possible presynaptic modification, an increase in axon excitability, was ruled out by analysis of the presynaptic fiber volley, which was not increased at any time after LTP induction.},

  abstract = {One of the brain sites more directly related with learning and memory processes is the hippocampus. We recorded, in conscious mice, the activity-dependent changes taking place at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse during the acquisition, extinction, recall, and reconditioning of an associative task. Mice were classically conditioned to evoke eyelid responses using a trace [conditioned stimuli (CS), tone; unconditioned stimuli (US), shock] paradigm. A single electrical pulse presented to the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway during the CS-US interval evoked a monosynaptic field EPSP (fEPSP) at ipsilateral CA1 pyramidal cells. The slope of evoked fEPSPs increased across conditioning sessions and decreased during extinction, being linearly related to learning evolution. In contrast, fEPSPs were not modified when evoked in control mice in the absence of a conditioning protocol. Long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked by high-frequency stimulation of Schaffer collaterals prevented acquisition, extinction, recall, or reconditioning, depending on the moment when it was triggered. Learning and memory impairments evoked by LTP induction resulted probably from the functional saturation of the CA3-CA1 synapse, although an additional disturbance of the subsequent information transfer toward postsynaptic circuits cannot be discarded. CGP 39551 [(E)-(+/-)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid ethyl ester] (an NMDA antagonist) prevented LTP induction in behaving mice, as well as the acquisition of an eyelid learned response, and the synaptic changes taking place at the CA3-CA1 synapse across conditioning. In conclusion, the responsivity of the CA3-CA1 synapse seems to be modulated during associative learning, and both processes are prevented by experimental LTP or NMDA-receptor inactivation. Our results provide evidence of a relationship between activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and associative learning in behaving mice.},

  abstract = {This paper critically discusses blind spots in AI ethics. AI ethics discourses typically stick to a certain set of topics concerning principles evolving mainly around explainability, fairness, and privacy. All these principles can be framed in a way that enables their operationalization by technical means. However, this requires stripping down the multidimensionality of very complex social constructs to something that is idealized, measurable, and calculable. Consequently, rather conservative, mainstream notions of the mentioned principles are conveyed, whereas critical research, alternative perspectives, and non-ideal approaches are largely neglected. Hence, one part of the paper considers specific blind spots regarding the very topics AI ethics focusses on. The other part, then, critically discusses blind spots regarding to topics that hold significant ethical importance but are hardly or not discussed at all in AI ethics. Here, the paper focuses on negative externalities of AI systems, exemplarily discussing the casualization of clickwork, AI ethics’ strict anthropocentrism, and AI’s environmental impact. Ultimately, the paper is intended to be a critical commentary on the ongoing development of the field of AI ethics. It makes the case for a rediscovery of the strength of ethics in the AI field, namely its sensitivity to suffering and harms that are caused by and connected to AI technologies.},

These efforts are propelled by various high-profile cases where biased algorithmic decision-making caused harm to women, people of color, minorities, etc. However, the AI fairness field still succumbs to a blind spot, namely its insensitivity to discrimination against animals. This paper is the first to describe the 'speciesist bias' and investigate it in several different AI systems. Speciesist biases are learned and solidified by AI applications when they are trained on datasets in which speciesist patterns prevail. These patterns can be found in image recognition systems, large language models, and recommender systems. Therefore, AI technologies currently play a significant role in perpetuating and normalizing violence against animals. This can only be changed when AI fairness frameworks widen their scope and include mitigation measures for speciesist biases. This paper addresses the AI community in this regard and stresses the influence AI systems can have on either increasing or reducing the violence that is inflicted on animals, and especially on farmed animals.},

We generated mice with two point mutations that impair CaMKII binding to the NMDAR GluN2B subunit. Ca2+-triggered postsynaptic accumulation is largely abrogated for CaMKII and destabilized for TARPs, which anchor AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR). LTP is reduced by 50\% and phosphorylation of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit by CaMKII, which enhances AMPAR conductance, impaired. The mutant mice learn the Morris water maze (MWM) as well as WT but show deficiency in recall during the period of early memory consolidation. Accordingly, the activity-driven interaction of CaMKII with the NMDAR is important for recall of MWM memory as early as 24 h, but not 1?2 h, after training potentially due to impaired consolidation.},

We generated mice with two point mutations that impair CaMKII binding to the NMDAR GluN2B subunit. Ca2+-triggered postsynaptic accumulation is largely abrogated for CaMKII and destabilized for TARPs, which anchor AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR). LTP is reduced by 50\% and phosphorylation of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit by CaMKII, which enhances AMPAR conductance, impaired. The mutant mice learn the Morris water maze (MWM) as well as WT but show deficiency in recall during the period of early memory consolidation. Accordingly, the activity-driven interaction of CaMKII with the NMDAR is important for recall of MWM memory as early as 24h, but not 1-2h, after training potentially due to impaired consolidation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a specific form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that is a leading mechanism of learning and memory in mammals. The properties of cooperativity, input specificity, and associativity are essential for LTP; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, based on experimentally observed phenomena, we introduce a computational model of synaptic plasticity in a pyramidal cell to explore the mechanisms responsible for the cooperativity, input specificity, and associativity of LTP. The model is based on molecular processes involved in synaptic plasticity and integrates gene expression involved in the regulation of neuronal activity. In the model, we introduce a local positive feedback loop of protein synthesis at each synapse, which is essential for bimodal response and synapse specificity. Bifurcation analysis of the local positive feedback loop of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling illustrates the existence of bistability, which is the basis of LTP induction. The local bifurcation diagram provides guidance for the realization of LTP, and the projection of whole system trajectories onto the two-parameter bifurcation diagram confirms the predictions obtained from bifurcation analysis. Moreover, model analysis shows that pre- and postsynaptic components are required to achieve the three properties of LTP. This study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the cooperativity, input specificity, and associativity of LTP, and the further construction of neural networks for learning and memory.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (l.t.p.) was studied in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices during development at post-natal days 1-8, 15 and 60. Tetanic stimulation at 100 Hz for 1 s was delivered to the fibres in stratum radiatum and the time course of potentiation was recorded in stratum pyramidale for 20 min after tetanus. L.t.p. was measured at 20 min post-tetanus as an increase in the amplitude of the population spike. The time course and magnitude of post-tetanic potentiation (p.t.p.) differed with age. For 60-day-old animals p.t.p. was seen as a maximally potentiated response immediately post-tetanus that declined to a smaller potentiated response by 5 min post-tetanus. For animals younger than 15 days the response was also maximally potentiated immediately post-tetanus with subsequent decline. However, the duration of maximal potentiation was shorter and the magnitude was less. A different time course of p.t.p. was observed at 15 days. The maximal potentiation was approximately equal to that seen at 60 days, but instead of declining, the response remained maximally potentiated throughout the entire post-tetanus monitoring period. L.t.p. was first observed at post-natal day 5, and by post-natal days 7 and 8 substantial levels of l.t.p. were seen consistently. The greatest magnitude of l.t.p. was found at 15 days, and was considerably more than that produced at 60 days. When the duration of l.t.p. was monitored for longer than 20 min the response declined back to pretetanus levels by 1-1 1/2 h for animals younger than 15 days. In 15-day-old rats the response remained maximally potentiated for the full 72 min that it was monitored, with no decline. In control experiments of low-frequency stimulation (l.f.s.) at 1/15 s for 100 stimuli, hippocampal slices from 60-day-old animals showed response elevation. In contrast, l.f.s. resulted in response decrement over time for slices from 5-15-day-old animals. Three measures of pretetanus excitability in area CA1 suggested an increase with age. The stimulus intensity required for field excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) threshold declined, the magnitude of the maximal population spike amplitude increased, and the population spike latency decreased. These results suggest that the magnitude of l.t.p. is not strictly related to the pretetanus excitability of CA1 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Serial electron microscopy and 3-D reconstructions of dendritic spines from hippocampal area CA 1 dendrites were obtained to evaluate 2 questions about relationships between spine geometry and synaptic efficacy. First, under what biophysical conditions are the spine necks likely to reduce the magnitude of charge transferred from the synapses on the spine heads to the recipient dendrite? Simulation software provided by Charles Wilson (1984) was used to determine that if synaptic conductance is 1 nS or less, only 1\% of the hippocampal spine necks are sufficiently thin and long to reduce charge transfer by more than 10\%. If synaptic conductance approaches 5 nS, however, 33\% of the hippocampal spine necks are sufficiently thin and long to reduce charge transfer by more than 10\%. Second, is spine geometry associated with other anatomical indicators of synaptic efficacy, including the area of the postsynaptic density and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axon? Reconstructed spines were graphically edited into head and neck compartments, and their dimensions were measured, the areas of the postsynaptic densities (PSD) were measured, and all of the vesicles in the presynaptic axonal varicosities were counted. The dimensions of the spine head were well correlated with the area of PSD and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axonal varicosity. Spine neck diameter and length were not correlated with PSD area, head volume, or the number of vesicles. These results suggest that the dimensions of the spine head, but not the spine neck, reflect differences in synaptic efficacy. We suggest that the constricted necks of hippocampal dendritic spines might reduce diffusion of activated molecules to neighboring synapses, thereby attributing specificity to activated or potentiated synapses.},

In this paper we describe compartmental BNGL (cBNGL), which extends BNGL to enable explicit modeling of the compartmental organization of the cell and its effects on system dynamics. We show that by making localization a queryable attribute of both molecules and species and introducing appropriate volumetric scaling of reaction rates, the effects of compartmentalization can be naturally modeled using rules. These properties enable the construction of new rule semantics that include both universal rules, those defining interactions that can take place in any compartment in the system, and transport rules, which enable movement of molecular complexes between compartments.},

The answer to the initial question, the self-experiment and the associated demand for openness, posed several challenges for a doctoral student, the institution, and the examination regulations, which are still based on the publication of an individually written and completed work that cannot be viewed by the public during the creation process. In the case of data and other documents, publication is usually not planned even after completion. This state of affairs in the use of open science in the humanities will be compared with open science best practices in the physical sciences. The reasons and influencing factors for open developments in science and research are presented, empirically and experimentally tested in the development of the first completely open humanities-based PhD thesis. The results of this two-part study show that it is possible to publish everything related to the doctoral study, qualification, and research process as soon as possible, as comprehensively as possible, and under an open license.},

New evidence now suggests that CaMKII can induce LTP purely by binding to the NMDAR subunit GluN2B and does not require the catalytic activity of the kinase.}

  abstract = {Synaptic proteomes have evolved a rich and complex diversity to allow the exquisite control of neuronal communication and information transfer. It is therefore not surprising that many neurological disorders are associated with alterations in synaptic function. As technology has advanced, our ability to study the anatomical and physiological function of synapses in greater detail has revealed a critical role for both central and peripheral synapses in neurodegenerative disease. Synapse loss has a devastating effect on cellular communication, leading to wide ranging effects such as network disruption within central neural systems and muscle wastage in the periphery. These devastating effects link synaptic pathology to a diverse range of neurological disorders, spanning Alzheimer’s disease to multiple sclerosis. This review will highlight some of the current literature on synaptic integrity in animal models of disease and human post-mortem studies. Synaptic changes in normal brain ageing will also be discussed and finally the current and prospective treatments for neurodegenerative disorders will be summarised.},

  abstract = {While Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research has at its core the desire to support student learning, experience from other AI domains suggest that such ethical intentions are not by themselves sufficient. There is also the need to consider explicitly issues such as fairness, accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency, and inclusion. At a more general level, there is also a need to differentiate between doing ethical things and doing things ethically, to understand and to make pedagogical choices that are ethical, and to account for the ever-present possibility of unintended consequences. However, addressing these and related questions is far from trivial. As a first step towards addressing this critical gap, we invited 60 of the AIED community’s leading researchers to respond to a survey of questions about ethics and the application of AI in educational contexts. In this paper, we first introduce issues around the ethics of AI in education. Next, we summarise the contributions of the 17 respondents, and discuss the complex issues that they raised. Specific outcomes include the recognition that most AIED researchers are not trained to tackle the emerging ethical questions. A well-designed framework for engaging with ethics of AIED that combined a multidisciplinary approach and a set of robust guidelines seems vital in this context.},

To test this theory, rats learned trial-unique sequences of spatial locations along a runway box and were tested on recall by removing one of the locations in the sequence and making the rat choose the correct location to be rewarded. Once animals were able to reliably perform this episodic memory task, they received lesions to either CA3 or CA1. Animals with lesions to either CA3 or CA1 had difficulty with episodic memory processing, although CA1 lesioned animals had a much greater deficit. However, when animals were trained on a non-episodic version of the same task, hippocampal lesions had no effect. These results suggest that CA3 and CA1 both contribute to episodic memory processing since lesions to CA3 or CA1 result in an inability to process spatial information episodically, whereas they have no effect on non-episodic information processing.},

  abstract = {Many researchers are currently studying the distribution of genetic variations among diverse groups, with particular interest in explaining racial/ethnic health disparities. However, the use of racial/ethnic categories as variables in biological research is controversial. Just how racial/ethnic categories are conceptualized, operationalized, and interpreted is a key consideration in determining the legitimacy of their use, but has received little attention. We conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 30 human genetics scientists from the US and Canada who use racial/ethnic variables in their research. They discussed the types of classifications they use, the criteria upon which they are based, and their methods for classifying individual samples and subjects. We found definitions of racial/ethnic variables were often lacking or unclear, the specific categories they used were inconsistent and context specific, and classification practices were often implicit and unexamined. We conclude that such conceptual and practical problems are inherent to routinely used racial/ethnic categories themselves, and that they lack sufficient rigor to be used as key variables in biological research. It is our position that it is unacceptable to persist in the constructing of scientific arguments based on these highly ambiguous variables.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

While this research presents exciting possibilities for informing social activism and policy, centering neuroscientific explanations for complex social issues often obscures social injustices not easily measurable with neuroscientific tools. Here, I discuss neuroscientific and psychological research into racism, drug addiction, and criminality that has 1) ‘over-individualized’ these issues by neglecting structural and environmental complexities,, and 2) ‘over-neuralized’ these issues by reducing them to neural phenomena, inscribing historical injustices into the ‘hardwiring’ of the brain under a veneer of scientific objectivity. Taken together, this research—on implicit racial bias, the ‘brain disease’ model of addiction, and the ‘criminal brain’—casts the brain as a moral scapegoat, allowing us to show mercy towards individuals without grappling with collective responsibility for the conditions of injustice at the heart of racism, addiction, and crime. Finally, I discuss recommendations for neuroscientific and psychological inquiry that is attentive to non-neural explanations and responsive to how the science of the brain is translated and communicated into broader society.},

  abstract = {1. Extracellular recordings from hippocampal area CA1 lasting 2-8 h posttetanus were used to evaluate the duration of long-term potentiation (LTP) at two key developmental ages. 2. At day 11 LTP consistently endured for approximately 1 h before declining to baseline by 2.5 h posttetanus. The response could then be repotentiated, and in some cases, the repotentiation lasted longer than the original potentiation. 3. At day 15 two patterns of potentiation were observed. The first pattern was similar to that observed at day 11 in that the potentiation did not persist; however, it did endure for approximately 2-2.5 h before declining to baseline by 4 h posttetanus. In the second pattern the potentiation persisted indefinitely; these responses were monitored for 6-8 h posttetanus. 4. These patterns are similar to the temporal phases of LTP that have been revealed in adult rat hippocampus through pharmacological manipulations. They may reflect developmental changes during which the different cellular mechanisms underlying LTP become sequentially activated. 5. These findings are important for several reasons. First, because the different temporal phases of LTP seem to be added stepwise during development, animals of different ages could be used explicitly to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms of these phases in LTP. Second, because LTP is a candidate mechanism for some forms of learning and memory, these results have implications for sequential steps in the ontogeny of learning and memory. Finally, because studies of LTP have used animals of widely varying ages, including these two ages, it is important to consider whether differences in the developmental properties of LTP could influence experimental observations.}

However, too often skepticism regarding animal minds, cognition, and experience (e.g., reluctance to attribute thoughts, beliefs, phenomenal consciousness, and sentience to certain taxa) is justified by reference to physiological heterologies in neural structure/complexity between humans and the other animals. An example is the argument that fish cannot experience pain because they lack the requisite neocortical structures. In this chapter, I contend that these kinds of scientific and philosophical arguments reflect a kind of anthropodenial embedded in speciesism and, specifically, human supremacy and neurotypicalism. I further argue that there is good reason to believe that vertebrates such as fish—and even some invertebrates such as crustaceans and insects/arachnids—are experiencing beings, that there is a what-it’s-like to be them, and that these conclusions have ethical implications.},

  abstract = {The time course of Mg2+ block and unblock of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) determines the extent they are activated by depolarization. Here, we directly measure the rate of NMDAR channel opening in response to depolarizations at different times after brief (1 ms) and sustained (4.6 s) applications of glutamate to nucleated patches from neocortical pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of Mg2+ unblock were found to be non-instantaneous and complex, consisting of a prominent fast component (time constant ∼100 μs) and slower components (time constants 4 and ∼300 ms), the relative amplitudes of which depended on the timing of the depolarizing pulse. Fitting a kinetic model to these data indicated that Mg2+ not only blocks the NMDAR channel, but reduces both the open probability and affinity for glutamate, while enhancing desensitization. These effects slow the rate of NMDAR channel opening in response to depolarization in a time-dependent manner such that the slower components of Mg2+ unblock are enhanced during depolarizations at later times after glutamate application. One physiological consequence of this is that brief depolarizations occurring earlier in time after glutamate application are better able to open NMDAR channels. This finding has important implications for spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP), where the precise (millisecond) timing of action potentials relative to synaptic inputs determines the magnitude and sign of changes in synaptic strength. Indeed, we find that STDP timing curves of NMDAR channel activation elicited by realistic dendritic action potential waveforms are narrower than expected assuming instantaneous Mg2+ unblock, indicating that slow Mg2+ unblock of NMDAR channels makes the STDP timing window more precise.},

Moreover, unlike other mental processes such as thought, language, and consciousness, learning seemed from the outset to be readily accessible to cellular and molecular analysis. I, therefore, have been curious to know: What changes in the brain when we learn? And, once something is learned, how is that information retained in the brain? I have tried to address these questions through a reductionist approach that would allow me to investigate elementary forms of learning and memory at a cellular molecular level-as specific molecular activities within identified nerve cells.},

Previous work has identified ELSI related to WRs, e.g., impacts on body and identity, ableism, data protection, control and responsibilities, but translation of these concerns into actionable recommendations remains outstanding. This paper provides practical guidance for the implementation of ELSI in WR design, development and use. First, we identify the need for domain-specific recommendations against the context of current ELSI guidance. We then demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of taking a domain-specific approach by successively transforming currently identified ELSI into an action-guiding flowchart for integration of ELSI specific to the different stages of WR development. This flowchart identifies specific questions to be considered by WR development teams and suggests actions to be taken in response. By tailoring ELSI guidance to WR developers, centring it on user needs, their relation to others and wider society, and being cognizant of existing legislation and values, we hope to help the community develop better WRs that are safer, have greater usability, and which impact positively on society.},

  abstract = {We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during the early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower-dimensional manageable system of closed equations. We found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e., during stimulation), and after that, they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that the learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong, positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. Moreover, we find that such efficiencies drop significantly with increasing the number of spines. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding, and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.},

  abstract = {A detailed and robust mathematical theory and modeling paradigms with discrete functions and relationships within diverse regions of the brain are essential to analyze the operations of neural system. Although the complete actions and events of nervous systems, with its causal entities, cannot be revealed by mathematical or statistical systems only, a requirement of dynamic and powerful virtual modeling paradigms is crucial for processing them. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as machine learning and deep learning have proven to be the unrivaled approaches for solving problems pertaining to numerous recognition systems. Computer vision systems integrated with enhanced neural network methods can provide qualitative and better results in the medical and healthcare sector to a large extent. The study of multifaceted models is therefore organized by discussing the current state-of-the-art in the field of computational neuroscience by focusing on the currently available tools and software resources for effectively carrying out the research work in this domain. The sources of relevant databases and online repositories consisting of brain-related imaging data for detailed research and investigation have also been comprehensively described.},

  abstract = {Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction‐based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint‐based models, reaction‐diffusion models, logical network models, and rule‐based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single‐cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.},

Such laboratory-reared animals are highly inbred, have been disengaged from their natural environments for generations and appear to be of limited predictive value for successful clinical outcomes. In this Perspective article, we argue that research on a rich diversity of animal model systems is fundamental to new discoveries in evolutionarily conserved core physiological and molecular mechanisms that are the foundation of human brain function. Analysis of neural circuits across phyla will reveal general computational solutions that form the basis for adaptive behavioral responses. Further, we stress that development of ethoexperimental approaches to improve our understanding of behavioral nuance will help to realign our research strategies with therapeutic goals and improve the translational validity of specific animal models. Finally, we suggest that neuroscience has a role in environmental conservation of habitat and fauna that will preserve and protect the ecological settings that drive species-specific behavioral adaptations. A rich biodiversity will enhance our understanding of human brain function and lead in unpredicted directions for development of therapeutic treatments for neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are a type of ion permeable channels playing critical roles in excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system by mediating different forms of synaptic plasticity, a mechanism thought to be the molecular basis of neuronal development, learning and memory formation. NMDARs form tetramers in the postsynaptic membrane, most generally associating two obligatory GluN1 subunits and two modulatory GluN2 (GluN2A-D) or GluN3 (GluN3A-B) subunits. In the hippocampus, the dominant GluN2 subunits are GluN2A and GluN2B, displaying different expression patterns, with GluN2B being highly expressed in early development while GluN2A levels increase gradually during postnatal development. In the forebrain, the plastic processes mediated by NMDARs, such as the adaptation of glutamate synapses and excitatory neuronal networks, mostly rely on the relative implication of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs that have different signaling properties. Although the molecular regulation of synaptic NMDARs has been under intense investigation over the last decades, the exact topology of these two subtypes within the postsynaptic membrane has remained elusive. Here we used a combination of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to characterize the surface distribution of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Both dSTORM and STED microscopy, based on different principles, enable to overcome the resolution barrier due to the diffraction limit of light. Using these techniques, we here unveil a differential nanoscale organization of native GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDARs in rat hippocampal neurons. Both NMDAR subtypes are organized in nanoscale structures (termed nanodomains) that differ in their number, area, and shape. These observed differences are also maintained in synaptic structures. During development of hippocampal cultures, the membrane organization of both NMDAR subtypes evolves, with marked changes for the topology of GluN2A-NMDARs. Furthermore, GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR nanoscale organizations are differentially affected by alterations of either interactions with PDZ scaffold proteins or CaMKII activity. The regulation of GluN2A-NMDARs mostly implicates changes in the number of receptors in fixed nanodomains, whereas the regulation of GluN2B-NMDARs mostly implicates changes in the nanodomain topography with fixed numbers of receptors. Thus, GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDARs have distinct organizations in the postsynaptic membrane, likely implicating different regulatory pathways and signaling complexes.},

First, the two proteins comigrate on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Second, iodinated tryptic peptide maps of the two are identical. Finally, a monoclonal antibody (6G9) that was raised against the protein kinase binds on immunoblots to a single 50 kDa band in crude brain homogenates and to both the alpha subunit of the purified kinase and the mPSDp from postsynaptic density fractions. The purified kinase holoenzyme also contains a 60-kDa subunit termed beta. A comparison of the peptide map of beta with the maps of 60-kDa proteins from the postsynaptic density fraction suggests that beta is present there but is not the only protein present in this molecular weight range. These results indicate that the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is a major constituent of the postsynaptic density fraction and thus may be a component of type I postsynaptic densities.},

  abstract = {A hierarchical, two‐stage approach to ab initio protein structure prediction is presented and applied to four α‐helical proteins. In the first stage, a bank of low‐resolution models is generated using a highly simplified protein representation and energy function, coupled with a Conformation‐Family Monte Carlo (CFMC) search for the energy minimum. For helical proteins, this procedure (referred to as REPACK) produces a set of plausible packed arrangements of the helices, given their positions in the amino acid sequence. Secondary structure prediction methods such as JPRED can be used to provide the secondary structure assignment. In the second stage, these packing arrangements are used as starting points for a new search method (Local Search), based on the Monte Carlo‐with‐Minimization (MCM) algorithm and a united‐residue (UNRES) energy function. The focus of the Local Search is mainly on improving loop conformations and side‐chain positions, with minor modifications to the overall packing of the helices. By reducing the size of the conformational space that must be sampled with the UNRES energy function, which is much more expensive to compute than the REPACK energy function, this prediction scheme can be applied to much larger proteins than were tractable in the past with other UNRES‐based search methods. It was applied successfully to a 224–residue protein (target T0198, PDB code 1SUM) in the sixth community‐wide blind‐prediction experiment on the Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP6).},

The program Smoldyn was used to develop scenarios of single molecule CaMKII diffusion and binding in virtual dendritic spines. We first validated simulation of diffusion as a function of spine morphology. Additional cellular structures were then incorporated to simulate binding of CaMKII to the post-synaptic density (PSD); binding to cytoskeleton; or their self-aggregation. The distributions of GFP tagged native and mutant constructs in dissociated hippocampal neurons were measured to guide quantitative analysis. Intra-spine viscosity was estimated from fluorescence recovery after photo-bleach (FRAP) of red fluorescent protein. Intra-spine mobility of the GFP-CaMKIIα constructs was measured, with hundred-millisecond or better time resolution, from FRAP of distal spine tips in conjunction with fluorescence loss (FLIP) from proximal regions. Different FRAP \textbackslash{} FLIP profiles were predicted from our Scenarios and provided a means to differentiate binding to the PSDs from self-aggregation. The predictions were validated by experiments. Simulated fits of the Scenarios provided estimates of binding and rate constants. We utilized these values to assess the role of self-aggregation during the initial response of native CaMKII holoenzymes to stimulation. The computations revealed that self-aggregation could provide a concentration-dependent switch to amplify CaMKII sequestration and regulate its activity depending on its occupancy of the actin cytoskeleton.},

  abstract = {Calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) has an important role in dendritic spine remodeling upon synaptic stimulation. Using fluorescence video microscopy and image analysis, we investigated the architectural dynamics of rhodamine-phalloidin stabilized filamentous actin (F-actin) networks cross-linked by CaMKII. We used automated image analysis to identify F-actin bundles and crossover junctions and developed a dimensionless metric to characterize network architecture. Similar networks were formed by three different CaMKII species with a 10-fold length difference in the linker region between the kinase domain and holoenzyme hub, implying linker length is not a primary determinant of F-actin cross-linking. Electron micrographs showed that at physiological molar ratios, single CaMKII holoenzymes cross-linked multiple F-actin filaments at random, whereas at higher CaMKII/F-actin ratios, filaments bundled. Light microscopy established that the random network architecture resisted macromolecular crowding with polyethylene glycol and blocked ATP-powered compaction by myosin-II miniature filaments. Importantly, the networks disassembled after the addition of calcium-calmodulin and were then spaced within 3~min into compacted foci by myosin motors or more slowly (30~min) aggregated by crowding. Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed CaMKII dissociation from surface-immobilized globular actin exhibited a monoexponential dwell-time distribution, whereas CaMKII bound to F-actin networks had a long-lived fraction, trapped at crossover junctions. Release of CaMKII from F-actin, triggered by calcium-calmodulin, was too rapid to measure with flow-cell exchange ({$<$}20~s). The residual bound fraction was reduced substantially upon addition of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor peptide analog but not ATP. These results provide mechanistic insights to CaMKII-actin interactions at the collective network and single-molecule level. Our findings argue that CaMKII-actin networks in dendritic spines maintain spine size against physical stress. Upon synaptic stimulation, CaMKII is disengaged by calcium-calmodulin, triggering network disassembly, expansion, and subsequent compaction by myosin motors with kinetics compatible with the times recorded for the poststimulus changes in spine volume.},

  abstract = {Stress can disturb cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and consequently limit the quality of human life. This review provides an overview of the neurobiology of stress–memory interactions, and presents a neural–endocrine model to explain how stress modifies hippocampal functioning. Stress can be defined as a condition in which an individual is aroused by an aversive situation, and its consequences are influenced greatly by the individual's perception of his or her ability to control the presence or intensity of the stimulus. The hippocampus is involved in both memory and the neuroendocrine regulation of stress hormones. Hippocampal functions, such as learning and memory, are susceptible to disruption by stress, mediated in part by the activation of type II corticosteroid (glucocorticoid) receptors. The primary physiological model of memory is long-term potentiation (LTP), and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological studies have shown that stress interferes with the induction of hippocampal LTP. In addition to affecting synaptic plasticity and memory, stress and corticosterone have been shown to alter hippocampal dendritic morphology and inhibit neurogenesis in the adult brain, which can also have an impact on memory-related functioning. The full expression of stress effects on the hippocampus seems to require co-activation of the amygdala and hippocampus, in concert with the direct actions on the hippocampus of neuromodulators, such as corticosterone, 5-hydroxytryptamine, opiates and corticotropin-releasing factor. The key assumption of the neuroendocrine model is that alterations in hippocampal functioning after stress are due to an excessive activity exerted by the amygdala on the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Kim and Ziff examine the molecular mechanism of synaptic scaling, showing that inhibition of neuronal excitability reduces calcium influx into neurons, resulting in decreased calcineurin activity. This leads to increased surface expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors as a homeostatic response., Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a negative-feedback mechanism for compensating excessive excitation or inhibition of neuronal activity. When neuronal activity is chronically suppressed, neurons increase synaptic strength across all affected synapses via synaptic scaling. One mechanism for this change is alteration of synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) accumulation. Although decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels caused by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity are believed to be an important trigger of synaptic scaling, the mechanism of Ca2+-mediated AMPAR-dependent synaptic scaling is not yet understood. Here, we use dissociated mouse cortical neurons and employ Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiological, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to describe a novel mechanism in which homeostasis of Ca2+ signaling modulates activity deprivation-induced synaptic scaling by three steps: (1) suppression of neuronal activity decreases somatic Ca2+ signals; (2) reduced activity of calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, increases synaptic expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CPARs) by stabilizing GluA1 phosphorylation; and (3) Ca2+ influx via CPARs restores CREB phosphorylation as a homeostatic response by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the ER. Therefore, we suggest that synaptic scaling not only maintains neuronal stability by increasing postsynaptic strength but also maintains nuclear Ca2+ signaling by synaptic expression of CPARs and ER Ca2+ propagation., Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that normalizes the strength of synapses (the structure that allows nerve cells to communicate) and is triggered by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity. Although extensive studies have been conducted, the molecular mechanism of this synaptic adaptation is not understood. Using cultured cortical neurons, we show that chronic inhibition of neuronal activity reduces calcium influx into neurons, which, in turn, decreases the activity of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. These changes lead to an increase in GluA1-containing, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which mediate communication at the synapse. Newly inserted calcium-permeable AMPA receptors restore calcium currents, which enhance synaptic strength and recover calcium signaling. We also show that inhibition or activation of calcineurin activity is sufficient to induce or block synaptic scaling, respectively, suggesting that calcineurin is an important mediator of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Taken together, our findings show that synaptic scaling is a homeostatic process that not only enhances synaptic transmission but also maintains calcium signaling in neurons under activity deprivation.},

  abstract = {The 3Rs, or the replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal research, are widely accepted as the best approach to maximizing high-quality science while ensuring the highest standard of ethical consideration is applied in regulating the use of animals in scientific procedures. This contrasts with the muted scientific interest in the 3Rs when they were first proposed in The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique (1959). Indeed, the relative success of the 3Rs has done little to encourage engagement with their original text, which remains little read and out of print. By adopting a historical perspective, this article argues that one explanation for this disjunction may be found in another, more celebrated, event of 1959: C. P. Snow's Rede lecture on The Two Cultures. The moral outlook of The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique derived from an earlier ethos wherein humanistic and scientific values occupied a shared culture. While the synthetic style of The Principles has hindered its readership, this article concludes that there is value to recovering the notion that the humanities and social sciences can contribute to the improvement of animal research.},

However, in larger networks it is hampered by the combinatorial explosion of possible routes. In this work we give some estimations on the combinatorial complexity including theoretical upper bounds for the number of elementary flux modes in a network of a given size. In a case study, we computed the elementary modes in the central metabolism of Escherichia coli while utilizing four different substrates. Interestingly, although the number of modes occurring in this complex network can exceed half a million, it is still far below the upper bound. Hence, to a certain extent, pathway analysis of central catabolism is feasible to assess network properties such as flexibility and functionality.},

  abstract = {Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease among older adults. The study aimed to investigate the interplay between socio-economic markers (education and financial resources) and polygenic predisposition influencing individual differences in depressive symptoms and their change over time in older adults, which is of central relevance for preventative strategies. The sample encompassing n\,=\,6202 adults aged ≥50 years old with a follow-up period of 14 years was utilised from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Polygenic scores for depressive symptoms were calculated using summary statistics for (1) single-trait depressive symptoms (PGS-DSsingle), and (2) multi-trait including depressive symptoms, subjective well-being, neuroticism, loneliness, and self-rated health (PGS-DSmulti-trait). The depressive symptoms over the past week were measured using the eight-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. One standard deviation increase in each PGS was associated with a higher baseline score in depressive symptoms. Each additional year of completed schooling was associated with lower baseline depression symptoms (β\,=\,−0.06, 95\%CI\,=\,−0.07 to −0.05, p\,{$<$}\,0.001); intermediate and lower wealth were associated with a higher baseline score in depressive symptoms. Although there was a weak interaction effect between PGS-DSs and socio-economic status in association with the baseline depressive symptoms, there were no significant relationships of PGS-DSs, socio-economic factors, and rate of change in the depressive symptoms during the 14-year follow-up period. Common genetic variants for depressive symptoms are associated with a greater number of depressive symptoms onset but not with their rate of change in the following 14 years. Lower socio-economic status is an important factor influencing individual levels of depressive symptoms, independently from polygenic predisposition to depressive symptoms.},

LTP is regarded as a principal candidate for the cellular mechanisms involved in learning and offers an attractive hypothesis of how memories are constructed.

  abstract = {NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that assemble into tetrameric receptor complexes composed of glycine-binding GluN1 and GluN3 subunits (GluN3A-B) and glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-D). NMDA receptors can assemble as GluN1/N2 receptors and as GluN3-containing NMDA receptors, which are either glutamate/glycine-activated triheteromeric GluN1/N2/N3 receptors or glycine-activated diheteromeric GluN1/N3 receptors. The glycine-binding GluN1 and GluN3 subunits display strikingly different pharmacological selectivity profiles. However, the pharmacological characterization of GluN3-containing receptors has been hampered by the lack of methods and pharmacological tools to study GluN3 subunit pharmacology in isolation. Here, we have developed a method to study the pharmacology of GluN3 subunits in recombinant diheteromeric GluN1/N3 receptors by mutating the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket in GluN1. This method is suitable for performing compound screening and characterization of structure-activity relationship studies on GluN3 ligands. We have performed a virtual screen of the orthosteric binding site of GluN3A in the search for antagonists with selectivity for GluN3 subunits. In the subsequent pharmacological evaluation of 99 selected compounds, we identified 6-hydroxy-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5(4H)-one (TK80) a novel competitive antagonist with preference for the GluN3B subunit. Serendipitously, we also identified [2-hydroxy-5-((4-(pyridin-3-yl)thiazol-2-yl)amino]benzoic acid (TK13) and 4-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (TK30), two novel non-competitive GluN3 antagonists. These findings demonstrate that structural differences between the orthosteric binding site of GluN3 and GluN1 can be exploited to generate selective ligands.},

  abstract = {Activity-dependent changes in excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS have been shown to depend on the regulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). In particular, several lines of evidence suggest that reversible phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1, also referred to as GluA1 or GluR-A) plays a role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We previously reported that regulation of serines (S) 831 and 845 on the GluR1 subunit may play a critical role in bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the Schaffer collateral inputs to CA1. Specifically, gene knockin mice lacking both S831 and S845 phosphorylation sites ("double phosphomutants"), where both serine residues were replaced by alanines (A), showed a faster decaying LTP and a deficit in LTD. To determine which of the two phosphorylation sites was responsible for the phenotype, we have now generated two lines of gene knockin mice: one that specifically lacks S831 (S831A mutants) and another that lacks only S845 (S845A mutants). We found that S831A mutants display normal LTP and LTD, whereas S845A mutants show a specific deficit in LTD. Taken together with our previous results from the "double phosphomutants," our data suggest that either S831 or S845 alone may support LTP, whereas the S845 site is critical for LTD expression.},

  abstract = {Determining the etiology of an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is fundamental to secondary stroke prevention efforts but can be diagnostically challenging. We trained and validated an automated classification machine intelligence tool, StrokeClassifier, using electronic health record (EHR) text data from 2,039 non-cryptogenic AIS patients at 2 academic hospitals to predict the 4-level outcome of stroke etiology determined by agreement of at least 2 board-certified vascular neurologists' review of the stroke hospitalization EHR. StrokeClassifier is an ensemble consensus meta-model of 9 machine learning classifiers applied to features extracted from discharge summary texts by natural language processing. StrokeClassifier was externally validated in 406 discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III dataset reviewed by a vascular neurologist to ascertain stroke etiology. Compared with stroke etiologies adjudicated by vascular neurologists, StrokeClassifier achieved the mean cross-validated accuracy of 0.74 (±0.01) and weighted F1 of 0.74 (±0.01). In the MIMIC-III cohort, the accuracy and weighted F1 of StrokeClassifier were 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis elucidated that the top 5 features contributing to stroke etiology prediction were atrial fibrillation, age, middle cerebral artery occlusion, internal carotid artery occlusion, and frontal stroke location. We then designed a certainty heuristic to deem a StrokeClassifier diagnosis as confidently non-cryptogenic by the degree of consensus among the 9 classifiers, and applied it to 788 cryptogenic patients. This reduced the percentage of the cryptogenic strokes from 25.2\% to 7.2\% of all ischemic strokes. StrokeClassifier is a validated artificial intelligence tool that rivals the performance of vascular neurologists in classifying ischemic stroke etiology for individual patients. With further training, StrokeClassifier may have downstream applications including its use as a clinical decision support system.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are small, bulbous compartments that function as postsynaptic sites and undergo intense biochemical and biophysical activity. The role of the myriad signaling pathways that are implicated in synaptic plasticity is well studied. A recent abundance of quantitative experimental data has made the events associated with synaptic plasticity amenable to quantitative biophysical modeling. Spines are also fascinating biophysical computational units because spine geometry, signal transduction, and mechanics work in a complex feedback loop to tune synaptic plasticity. In this sense, ideas from modeling cell motility can inspire us to develop multiscale approaches for predictive modeling of synaptic plasticity. In this article, we review the key steps in postsynaptic plasticity with a specific focus on the impact of spine geometry on signaling, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and membrane mechanics. We summarize the main experimental observations and highlight how theory and computation can aid our understanding of these complex processes.

  abstract = {Diversity is an undeniable fact of nature (Gaston and Spicer in Biodiversity: an introduction. Wiley, Hoboken, 2004), and there is now evidence that nature did not stop generating diversity just before “designing” the human brain (Joel et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 112(50):15,468–15,473. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1509654112, 2015). If neurodiversity is a fact of nature, what about neurodivergence? Although the terms “neurodiversity” and “neurodivergence” are sometimes used interchangeably, this is, we believe, a mistake: “neurodiversity” is a term of inclusion whereas “neurodivergence” is a term of exclusion. To make the difference clear, note that everyone can be said to be neurodiverse, but that it is almost impossible for everyone to be neurodivergent. Neurodivergence is, we claim here, a fact of society. Neurodivergent individuals are those whose cognitive profile diverges from an established cognitive norm, a norm that is not an objective statistical fact of human neurological functioning but a standard established and maintained by socio-political processes. In this paper, we describe the socio-political mechanisms that build neurodivergence out of neurodiversity which, inspired by Mihai (Contemp Polit Theory 17(4):395–416. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41296-017-0186-z, 2018), we call “epistemic and cognitive marginalization”. First, we extend the traditional concept of neurodiversity, which we believe too closely tied to a neuroreductionist conception of cognition, to that of “extended neurodiversity,” thereby viewing neurodiversity through the lens of 4E (i.e., embodied, embedded, extended, and enactive) cognition. Considering that human cognition depends on epistemic resources, both for their construction (diachronic dependence) and their online dynamic expression (synchronic dependence), we hypothesize that the differential access to epistemic resources in society, a form of epistemic injustice, is an overlooked mechanism that turns neurodiversity into neurodivergence. In doing so, we shed light on a type of epistemic injustice that might be missing from the epistemic injustice literature: cognitive injustices.},

  abstract = {This report analyzes long term potentiation (LTP) and associative interactions between synapses of the ipsilateral and crossed entorhinal cortical (EC) pathways to the dentate gyrus (DG). In the anesthetized rat, conditioning stimulation to one EC-DG pathway reliably elicits LTP at the ipsilateral synapses, while the synapses of the collateral, crossed pathway to the contralateral DG do not exhibit LTP. Furthermore, in the DG ipsilateral to the conditioning stimulation the convergent crossed pathway from the contralateral side, which had not been itself conditioned, failed to exhibit heterosynaptic LTP. These results are consistent with a specific ‘synaptic’ localization of the changes responsible for LTP, and suggest that some critical number of synapses must be activated in order to observed LTP. While the crossed EC-DG projection never exhibited LTP when conditioned alone, the crossed input could be potentiated under certain circumstances. Specifically, paired conditioning of ipsi- and contralateral inputs by nearly simultaneous conditioning stimulation of the EC bilaterally results in LTP in the crossed system. Futhermore, this associatively induced LTP of the crossed system can be reversed by subsequent conditioning of the ipsilateral system alone. Successive potentiating and depotentiating sequences are possible using paired and non-paired stimulation procedures even after lesions which prevent neural loops through the EC. The results are interpreted as evidence for a ‘Hebb’ type synapse which has the capability for erasure. This synaptic type is not appropriate for classical conditioning without appendant circuitry, but is suited for other forms of associative learning.},

  abstract = {Calmodulin sits at the center of molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Its complex and sometimes opposite influences, mediated via the binding to various proteins, are yet to be fully understood. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN) both bind open calmodulin, favoring Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) or Depression (LTD) respectively. Neurogranin binds to the closed conformation of calmodulin and its impact on synaptic plasticity is less clear. We set up a mechanistic computational model based on allosteric principles to simulate calmodulin state transitions and its interactions with calcium ions and the three binding partners mentioned above. We simulated calcium spikes at various frequencies and show that neurogranin regulates synaptic plasticity along three modalities. At low spike frequencies, neurogranin inhibits the onset of LTD by limiting CaN activation. At intermediate frequencies, neurogranin facilitates LTD, but limits LTP by precluding binding of CaMKII with calmodulin. Finally, at high spike frequencies, neurogranin promotes LTP by enhancing CaMKII autophosphorylation. While neurogranin might act as a calmodulin buffer, it does not significantly preclude the calmodulin opening by calcium. On the contrary, neurogranin synchronizes the opening of calmodulin’s two lobes and promotes their activation at specific frequencies. Neurogranin suppresses basal CaN activity, thus increasing the chance of CaMKII trans-autophosphorylation at high-frequency calcium spikes. Taken together, our study reveals dynamic regulatory roles played by neurogranin on synaptic plasticity, which provide mechanistic explanations for opposing experimental findings.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms that result in synapse-specific activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) have been determined.CaMKII translocates to the synapse during long-term potentiation (LTP), in part owing to binding of CaMKII to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR).One component of early LTP involves CaMKII phosphorylation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), which increases the average channel conductance of AMPARs.Early LTP also involves the phosphorylation of stargazin by CaMKII, which allows extrasynaptic AMPARs to bind to postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), thereby anchoring more AMPARs at the synapse.The molecular memory at a synapse may involve the formation of CaMKII–NMDAR complexes.Late LTP involves spine and synapse growth, the underlying mechanisms of which are not known.},

  abstract = {Memory involves the storage of information at synapses by an LTP-like process. This information storage is synapse specific and can endure for years despite the turnover of all synaptic proteins. There must, therefore, be special principles that underlie the stability of LTP. Recent experimental results suggest that LTP is maintained by the complex of CaMKII with the NMDAR. Here we consider the specifics of the CaMKII/NMDAR molecular switch, with the goal of understanding the biochemical principles that underlie stable information storage by synapses. Consideration of a variety of experimental results suggests that multiple principles are involved. One switch requirement is to prevent spontaneous transitions from the off to the on state. The highly cooperative nature of CaMKII autophosphorylation by Ca2+ (Hill coefficient of 8) and the fact that formation of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex requires release of CaMKII from actin are mechanisms that stabilize the off state. The stability of the on state depends critically on intersubunit autophosphorylation, a process that restores any loss of pT286 due to phosphatase activity. Intersubunit autophosphorylation is also important in explaining why on state stability is not compromised by protein turnover. Recent evidence suggests that turnover occurs by subunit exchange. Thus, stability could be achieved if a newly inserted unphosphorylated subunit was autophosphorylated by a neighboring subunit. Based on other recent work, we posit a novel mechanism that enhances the stability of the on state by protection of pT286 from phosphatases. We posit that the binding of the NMNDAR to CaMKII forces pT286 into the catalytic site of a neighboring subunit, thereby protecting pT286 from phosphatases. A final principle concerns the role of structural changes. The binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR may act as a tag to organize the binding of further proteins that produce the synapse enlargement that underlies late LTP. We argue that these structural changes not only enhance transmission, but also enhance the stability of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex. Together, these principles provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how individual synapses produce stable information storage.},

The cellular expression of NR2A and NR2B and the NR2 synaptic binding protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) was examined in the mouse somatosensory cortex and thalamus from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P15 using reverse transcription-PCR, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. The localization of NR2A and NR2B subunits and PSD-95 was then studied at synapses in layer IV of somatosensory cortex and in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus using high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. At both cortical and thalamic synapses, a quantitative switch in the dominant synaptic subunit from NR2B to NR2A was accompanied by a similar change in the cellular expression of NR2A but not of NR2B. Synaptic PSD-95 developed independently, although both NR2A and NR2B colocalized with PSD-95. Displacement of NR2B subunits from synapses was not accompanied by an increase in an extrasynaptic pool of this subunit. Thus, the switch in synaptic NR2 subunit predominance does not occur by changes in expression or displacement from synapses and may reflect the formation of new synapses from which NR2B is lacking.},

One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper. Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find, again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar research. Taken together, these findings highlight significant challenges facing non-White scientists.},

  abstract = {Mathematical equations are fundamental to modeling biological networks, but as networks get large and revisions frequent, it becomes difficult to manage equations directly or to combine previously developed models. Multiple simultaneous efforts to create graphical standards, rule‐based languages, and integrated software workbenches aim to simplify biological modeling but none fully meets the need for transparent, extensible, and reusable models. In this paper we describe PySB, an approach in which models are not only created using programs, they are programs. PySB draws on programmatic modeling concepts from little b and ProMot, the rule‐based languages BioNetGen and Kappa and the growing library of Python numerical tools. Central to PySB is a library of macros encoding familiar biochemical actions such as binding, catalysis, and polymerization, making it possible to use a high‐level, action‐oriented vocabulary to construct detailed models. As Python programs, PySB models leverage tools and practices from the open‐source software community, substantially advancing our ability to distribute and manage the work of testing biochemical hypotheses. We illustrate these ideas using new and previously published models of apoptosis.},

To this end, we developed a detailed state model of CaMKII activation and autophosphorylation based on the currently available literature, and constrained it with data from CaMKII autophosphorylation essays. Our model takes exact phosphorylation patterns of CaMKII holoenzymes into account, and is valid at physiologically relevant conditions where the concentrations of calcium and calmodulin are not saturating. Our results strongly suggest that even when bound to less than fully calcium-bound calmodulin, CaMKII is in the active state, and indicate that the autophosphorylation of T286 by an active non-phosphorylated CaMKII subunit is significantly faster than by an autophosphorylated CaMKII subunit. These results imply that CaMKII can be efficiently activated at significantly lower calcium concentrations than previously thought, which may explain how CaMKII gets activated at calcium concentrations existing at synapses in vivo. We also investigated the significance of CaMKII holoenzyme structure on CaMKII autophosphorylation and obtained estimates of previously unknown binding constants.},

Physiol Rev 84: 87–136, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00014.2003.—One of the most significant challenges in neuroscience is to identify the cellular and molecular processes that underlie learning and memory formation. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding changes that accompany certain forms of acquisition and recall, particularly those forms which require activation of afferent pathways in the hippocampus. This progress can be attributed to a number of factors including well-characterized animal models, well-defined probes for analysis of cell signaling events and changes in gene transcription, and technology which has allowed gene knockout and overexpression in cells and animals. Of the several animal models used in identifying the changes which accompany plasticity in synaptic connections, long-term potentiation (LTP) has received most attention, and although it is not yet clear whether the changes that underlie maintenance of LTP also underlie memory consolidation, significant advances have been made in understanding cell signaling events that contribute to this form of synaptic plasticity. In this review, emphasis is focused on analysis of changes that occur after learning, especially spatial learning, and LTP and the value of assessing these changes in parallel is discussed. The effect of different stressors on spatial learning/memory and LTP is emphasized, and the review concludes with a brief analysis of the contribution of studies, in which transgenic animals were used, to the literature on memory/learning and LTP.},

  abstract = {Memory formation transpires to be by activation and persistent modification of synapses. A chain of biochemical events accompany synaptic activation and culminate in memory formation. These biochemical events are steered by interplay and modulation of various synaptic proteins, achieved by conformational changes and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these proteins. Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are synaptic proteins whose interactions play a pivotal role in learning and memory process. Catalytic activity of CaMKII is modulated upon its interaction with the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR. The structural basis of this interaction is not clearly understood. We have investigated the role of Glu60 of α-CaMKII, a conserved residue present in the ATP binding region of kinases, in the regulation of catalysis of CaMKII by GluN2B. Mutation of Glu60 to Gly exerts different effects on the kinetic parameters of phosphorylation of GluN2B and GluN2A, of which only GluN2B binds to the T-site of CaMKII. GluN2B induced modulation of the kinetic parameters of peptide substrate was altered in the E60G mutant. The mutation almost abolished the modulation of the apparent Km value for protein substrate. However, although kinetic parameters for ATP were altered by mutating Glu60, modulation of the apparent Km value for ATP by GluN2B seen in WT was exhibited by the E60G mutant of α-CaMKII. Hence our results posit that the communication of the T-site of CaMKII with protein substrate binding region of active site is mediated through Glu60 while the communication of the T-site with the ATP binding region is not entirely dependent on Glu60.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse is an excellent experimental model for studying the interactions between short- and long-term plastic changes taking place following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of Schaffer collaterals and during the acquisition and extinction of a classical eyeblink conditioning in behaving mice. Input/output curves and a full-range paired-pulse study enabled determining the optimal intensities and inter-stimulus intervals for evoking paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or depression (PPD) at the CA3-CA1 synapse. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by HFS lasted ≈10 days. HFS-induced LTP evoked an initial depression of basal PPF. Recovery of PPF baseline values was a steady and progressive process lasting ≈20 days, i.e., longer than the total duration of the LTP. In a subsequent series of experiments, we checked whether PPF was affected similarly during activity-dependent synaptic changes. Animals were conditioned using a trace paradigm, with a tone as a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an electrical shock to the trigeminal nerve as an unconditioned stimulus (US). A pair of pulses (40 ms interval) was presented to the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway to evoke field EPSPs (fEPSPs) during the CS-US interval. Basal PPF decreased steadily across conditioning sessions (i.e., in the opposite direction to that during LTP), reaching a minimum value during the 10th conditioning session. Thus, LTP and classical eyeblink conditioning share some presynaptic mechanisms, but with an opposite evolution. Furthermore, PPF and PPD might play a homeostatic role during long-term plastic changes at the CA3-CA1 synapse.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We built a biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity describing CaMKII, PKA, and PKC pathways and their contribution to synaptic potentiation or depression. We developed a statistical AMPA-receptor-tetramer model, which permits the estimation of the AMPA-receptor-mediated maximal synaptic conductance based on numbers of GluR1s and GluR2s predicted by the biochemical signalling model. We show that our model reproduces neuromodulator-gated spike-timing-dependent plasticity as observed in the visual cortex and can be fit to data from many cortical areas, uncovering the biochemical contributions of the pathways pinpointed by the underlying experimental studies. Our model explains the dependence of different forms of plasticity on the availability of different proteins and can be used for the study of mental disorder-associated impairments of cortical plasticity.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is the most abundant kinase within excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. It interacts with and phosphorylates a large number of synaptic proteins, including major ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), to constitutively and/or activity-dependently regulate trafficking, subsynaptic localization, and function of the receptors. Among iGluRs, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a direct target of CaMKII. By directly binding to an intracellular C-terminal (CT) region of NMDAR GluN2B subunits, CaMKII phosphorylates a serine residue (S1303) in the GluN2B CT. CaMKII also phosphorylates a serine site (S831) in the CT of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors. This phosphorylation enhances channel conductance and is critical for synaptic plasticity. In addition to iGluRs, CaMKII binds to the proximal CT region of mGluR1a, which enables the kinase to phosphorylate threonine 871. Agonist stimulation of mGluR1a triggers a CaMKII-mediated negative feedback to facilitate endocytosis and desensitization of the receptor. CaMKII also binds to the mGluR5 CT. This binding seems to anchor and accumulate inactive CaMKII at synaptic sites. Active CaMKII dissociates from mGluR5 and may then bind to adjacent GluN2B to mediate the mGluR5-NMDAR coupling. Together, glutamate receptors serve as direct substrates of CaMKII. By phosphorylating these receptors, CaMKII plays a central role in controlling the number and activity of the modified receptors and determining the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission.},

In general, mGluRs modulate different traits of neuronal physiology, including excitability and plasticity processes. Particularly, group I mGluRs located at the pre- or postsynaptic compartments are involved in spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at hippocampal and neocortical synapses. Their roles of participating in the underlying mechanisms for detection of activity coincidence in STDP induction are debated, and diverse findings support models involving mGluRs in STDP forms in which NMDARs do not operate as classical postsynaptic coincidence detectors. Here, we briefly review the involvement of group I mGluRs in STDP and their possible role as coincidence detectors.},

Our model can also account for the greater-than-control CaMKII activation observed with added EGTA during depolarization. Calcium input currents are modeled after experimental observations, and existing models of calmodulin and CaMKII autophosphorylation are used. After calibration against CaMKII activation data in the absence of chelators, CaMKII activation dynamics due to synaptic input via n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors are qualitatively accounted for in the presence of the chelators EGTA and BAPTA without additional adjustments to the model. To account for CaMKII activation dynamics during spine depolarization with added EGTA or BAPTA, the model invokes the modulation of CaV2.3 (R-type) voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) currents observed in the presence of EGTA or BAPTA. To our knowledge, this is a novel explanation for the increased CaMKII activation seen in dendritic spines with added EGTA, and suggests that differential modulation of VDCCs by EGTA and BAPTA offers an alternative or complementary explanation for other experimental results in which addition of EGTA or BAPTA produces different effects. Our results also show that a simplified reaction network in a single, well-mixed compartment is sufficient to account for the general features of observed CaMKII dynamics.},

The goal is both to understand synaptic plasticity mechanisms, such as long-term potentiation, at a molecular level and to understand the relationship of these synaptic mechanisms to behavioral memory. Although both involve the activation of multiple signaling pathways, recent studies are beginning to define discrete roles and mechanisms for individual kinases in the different temporal phases of both synaptic and behavioral plasticity.},

These signals are propagated by kinases of the Src and Syk families, which activate several adaptor molecules to trigger Ca(2+) release and, in turn, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. In this study, we show that a constitutively active form of CaMKII antagonizes TCR signaling and impairs positive selection of thymocytes in mice. Following TCR engagement, active CaMKII decreases TCR-mediated CD3zeta chain phosphorylation and ZAP70 recruitment, preventing further downstream events. Therefore, we propose that CaMKII belongs to a negative-feedback loop that modulates the strength of the TCR signal through the tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP-2).},

  abstract = {Brain synapses are neuronal structures of the greatest interest. For a long time, however, the knowledge about them was variable, and interest was mostly focused on their pre-synaptic portions, especially neurotransmitter release from axon terminals. In the present review interest is focused on post-synapses, the structures receiving and converting pre-synaptic messages. Upon further modulation, such messages are transferred to dendritic fibers. Dendrites are profoundly different from axons; they are shorter and of variable thickness. Their post-synapses are of two types. Those called flat/intended/aspines, integrated into dendritic fibers, are very frequent in inhibitory neurons. The spines, small and stemming protrusions, connected to dendritic fibers by their necks, are present in almost all excitatory neurons. Several structures and functions including the post-synaptic densities and associated proteins, the nanoscale mechanisms of compartmentalization, the cytoskeletons of actin and microtubules, are analogous in the two post-synaptic forms. However other properties, such as plasticity and its functions of learning and memory, are largely distinct. Several properties of spines, including emersion from dendritic fibers, growth, change in shape and decreases in size up to disappearance, are specific. Spinal heads correspond to largely independent signaling compartments. They are motile, their local signaling is fast, however transport through their thin necks is slow. When single spines are activated separately, their dendritic effects are often lacking; when multiple spines are activated concomitantly, their effects take place. Defects of post-synaptic responses, especially those of spines, take place in various brain diseases. Here alterations affecting symptoms and future therapy are shown to occur in neurodegenerative diseases and autism spectrum disorders.},

  abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent.}

By fluorescence emission anisotropy, the affinity of CaM kinase for dansylated calmodulin was measured and found to increase 1000 times after autophosphorylation of the threonine at position 286 of the protein. Autophosphorylation markedly slowed the release of bound calcium-calmodulin; the release time increased from less than a second to several hundred seconds. In essence, calmodulin is trapped by autophosphorylation. The shift in affinity does not occur in a site-directed mutant in which threonine at position 286 has been replaced by a non-phosphorylatable amino acid. These experiments demonstrate the existence of a new state in which calmodulin is bound to CaM kinase even though the concentration of calcium is basal. Calmodulin trapping provides for molecular potentiation of calcium transients and may enable detection of their frequency.}

Some of the contributions of animal research have led to improvements in the welfare of animals. Animal research has also led to advances in psychotherapy, especially behavior therapy and behavioral medicine; rehabilitation of neuromuscular disorders; understanding and alleviating effects of stress and pain; discovery and testing of drugs for treatment of anxiety, psychosis, and Parkinson's disease; knowledge about mechanisms of drug addiction, relapse, and damage to the fetus; and understanding the mechanisms of some deficits of memory that occur with aging.

These changes suggest a mechanism by which the kinase could act as a calcium-triggered molecular switch. Incorporation of 3-12 of a possible total of 30 phosphate groups per holoenzyme causes kinase activity toward exogenous substrates as well as autophosphorylation itself to become independent of calcium. Thus, kinase activity could be prolonged beyond the duration of an initial activating calcium signal. The calcium-independent autophosphorylation could further prolong the active state by opposing dephosphorylation by cellular phosphatases.},

  abstract = {Molecular switches have been implicated in the storage of information in biological systems. For small structures such as synapses, these switches are composed of only a few molecules and stochastic fluctuations are therefore of importance. Such fluctuations could potentially lead to spontaneous switch reset that would limit the lifetime of information storage. We have analyzed a model of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) switch implicated in long-term memory in the nervous system. The bistability of this switch arises from autocatalytic autophosphorylation of CaMKII, a reaction that is countered by a saturable phosphatase-1-mediated dephosphorylation. We sought to understand the factors that control switch stability and to determine the functional relationship between stability and the number of molecules involved. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the lifetime of states of the switch increase exponentially with the number of CaMKII holoenzymes. Switch stability requires a balance between the kinase and phosphatase rates, and the kinase rate must remain high relative to the rate of protein turnover. Thus, a critical limit on switch stability is set by the observed turnover rate (one per 30 h on average). Our computational results show that, depending on the timescale of fluctuations in enzyme numbers, for a switch composed of about 15 CaMKII holoenzymes, the stable persistent activation can span from a few years to a human lifetime.},

While it is now a prominent part of educators, many still find it challenging to apply the concept for it carries diverse meaning for different people in different contexts. This article attempts to (re)conceptualize the complexity of reflective practice in an educational context. Scholars in this field have taken different approaches to reflective practice, but all these approaches consist of four main components in common: (i) reflecting; (ii) planning for future action; (iii) acting; and (iv) evaluating the outcomes. We extend the existing literature by proposing a model which integrates these four components with three key aspects of reflection: problem-solving, action orientation, and criticality. The novelty of this model lies within its alignment of the three key aspects with different levels of criticality in a comprehensive framework with detailed descriptors provided. The model and its descriptors are useful in guiding individuals who directly or indirectly involve in critical reflection, especially educators, in appraising their levels of criticality and consequently engage in a meaningful reflection.},

In addition to its Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-stimulated kinase activity, it can also bind to a variety of membrane proteins at the synapse and thus exert spatially restricted activity. The abundance of CaMKII in glutamatergic synapse is akin to scaffolding proteins although its prominent function still appears to be that of a kinase. The multimeric structure of CaMKII also confers several functional capabilities on the enzyme. The versatility of the enzyme has prompted hypotheses proposing several roles for the enzyme such as Ca\textsuperscript{2+} signal transduction, memory molecule function and scaffolding.

  abstract = {The neonatal hippocampus exhibits regularly recurring waves of synchronized neuronal activity in vitro. Because active sleep (AS), characterized by bursts of phasic motor activity in the form of myoclonic twitching, may provide conditions that are conducive to activity-dependent development of hippocampal circuits, we hypothesized that the waves of synchronous neuronal activity that have been observed in vitro would be associated with AS-related twitching. Using unanesthetized 1- to 12-d-old rats, we report here that the majority of neurons in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) are significantly more active during AS than during either quiet sleep or wakefulness. Neuronal activity typically occurs in phasic bursts, during which most neurons are significantly cross-correlated both within and across the CA1 and DG fields. All AS-active neurons increase their firing rates during periods of myoclonic twitching of the limbs, and a subset of these neurons exhibit a burst of activity immediately after limb twitches, suggesting that the twitches themselves provide sensory feedback to the infant hippocampus, as occurs in the infant spinal cord and neocortex. Finally, the synchronous bursts of neuronal activity are coupled to the emergence of the AS-related hippocampal gamma rhythm during the first postnatal week, as well as the emergence of the AS-related theta rhythm during the second postnatal week. We hypothesize that the phasic motor events of active sleep provide the developing hippocampus with discrete sensory stimulation that contributes to the development and refinement of hippocampal circuits as well as the development of synchronized interactions between hippocampus and neocortex.},

(2003) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci., 358, 773–786.] These are that (i) activity-dependent synaptic plasticity plays a key role in the automatic encoding and initial storage of attended experience; (ii) the persistence of hippocampal synaptic potentiation over time can be influenced by other independent neural events happening closely in time, an idea with behavioural implications for memory; and (iii) that systems-level consolidation of memory traces within neocortex is guided both by hippocampal traces that have been subject to cellular consolidation and by the presence of organized schema in neocortex into which relevant newly encoded information might be stored. Hippocampal memory is associative and, to study it more effectively than with previous paradigms, a new learning task is described which is unusual in requiring the incidental encoding of flavour–place paired associates, with the readout of successful storage being successful recall of a place given the flavour with which it was paired. NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity is shown to be critical for the encoding and intermediate storage of memory traces in this task, while AMPA receptor-mediated fast synaptic transmission is necessary for memory retrieval. Typically, these rapidly encoded traces decay quite rapidly over time. Synaptic potentiation also decays rapidly, but can be rendered more persistent by a process of cellular consolidation in which synaptic tagging and capture play a key part in determining whether or not it will be persistent. Synaptic tags set at the time of an event, even many trivial events, can capture the products of the synthesis of plasticity proteins set in train by events before, during or even after an event to be remembered. Tag–protein interactions stabilize synaptic potentiation and, by implication, memory. The behavioural implications of tagging are explored. Finally, using a different protocol for flavour–place paired associate learning, it is shown that rats can develop a spatial schema which represents the relative locations of several different flavours of food hidden at places within a familiar space. This schema is learned gradually but, once acquired, enables new paired associates to be encoded and stored in one trial. Their incorporation into the schema prevents rapid forgetting and suggests that schema play a key and hitherto unappreciated role in systems-level memory consolidation. The elements of what may eventually mature into a more formal neurobiological theory of hippocampal memory are laid out as specific propositions with detailed conceptual discussion and reference to recent data.},

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

New technologies, and increased use of more naturalistic observations, have enabled investigators to delve deeply into the structures that mediate episodic memory, particularly the hippocampus, and to track functional and structural interactions among brain regions that support it. Conceptually, episodic memory is increasingly being viewed as subject to lifelong transformations that are reflected in the neural substrates that mediate it. In keeping with this dynamic perspective, research on episodic memory (and the hippocampus) has infiltrated domains, from perception to language and from empathy to problem solving, that were once considered outside its boundaries. Using the component process model as a framework, and focusing on the hippocampus, its subfields, and specialization along its longitudinal axis, along with its interaction with other brain regions, we consider these new developments and their implications for the organization of episodic memory and its contribution to functions in other domains.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is activated by Ca2+ entry into neurons. Autophosphorylation of T286 is of special importance because it makes the enzyme active in the absence of Ca2+, providing a biochemical memory that is critical for plasticity. To understand the factors controlling the duration of this state of CaMKII, we studied dephosphorylation of CaMKII in the post-synaptic density (PSD), a structure that defines a neuronal subcompartment critical for plasticity. We found that PSD-resident PP1 can dephosphorylate many sites on CaMKII, but not the T286 site that produces Ca2+-independent activity. This, together with previous work showing that soluble PP2A cannot dephosphorylate PSD CaMKII, provides a novel explanation for the in vivo persistence of T286 phosphorylation: after activated CaMKII translocates from the cytoplasm to the PSD, structural constraints prevent phosphatases from dephosphorylating T286. These results also suggest that the PSD is more than a simple scaffold for synaptic proteins; it may act to regulate the activity of proteins by positioning them in orientations that either prevent or favor specific biochemical reactions.},

As expected from earlier work, only slices of two-week-old animals showed a consistent degree of long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to patterned high frequency stimulation. Several other synaptic properties were found to change during this developmental period. Inhibitory responses were absent in 7–9 day old but not in 12–15 day old neonates. Paired-pulse facilitation and the calcium sensitivity of postsynaptic responses were considerably reduced in 7–9 as compared to 12–15 day old rats. However, phorbol esters and 4-aminopyridine treatment still produced a strong facilitation of field potentials. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) component of responses to single pulse stimulation in low magnesium medium was found to be larger in slices of 7–9 than 12–15 day old or adult animals. At the two time periods examined, trains of high frequency stimulation applied in the presence of regular magnesium elicited an NMDA dependent response. It is concluded that the differences in synaptic properties observed between 7–9 and 12–15 day old neonates may not account for the absence of LTP in the younger animals.},

Although the majority of research in this field has concentrated primarily on protein kinases, the significant role of PPs is becoming increasingly apparent.

  abstract = {Animal studies have proven useful in addressing aspects of memory formation and consolidation that cannot be readily answered in research with humans. In particular, they offer the possibility of controlling both the extent and locus of brain lesions, and the exact nature of the experiences to be remembered. Taking advantage of these possibilities, recent studies indicated that the graded retrograde amnesia often seen after lesions to the hippocampal system is not uniform across lesion site and task, nor is it an indication that all of the remembered information available in intact subjects becomes available after hippocampal system lesions made a long time after learning. Rather, these studies support the notion that information is stored in both hippocampal and extrahipocampal sites, and that retrieval from different sites involves access to different kinds of information. The strongest evidence in support of this view is the set of findings indicating that when remote memories are retrieved, in either human or animal subjects that have suffered hippocampal system damage, these memories are not qualitatively the same as remote memories retrieved in intact subjects. In sum, memory appears to be rather more dynamic than most current conceptions allow, such that retrieval events trigger new encodings, and these new encodings engage the hippocampal system once again. As a result, older, reactivated memories become more resistant to disruption, and this mechanism helps to explain why graded retrograde amnesia is sometimes seen after brain damage. The use of new neuroimaging techniques, coupled with more sensitive neuropsychological tests in lesioned subjects, should further illuminate the complex nature of memory in coming years. It is likely that animal studies will continue to prove important in these developments. Hippocampus 2001;11:56–60. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In living cells, the autoinhibited holoenzyme is organized as catalytic-domain pairs distributed around a central oligomerization-domain core. The functional significance of catalytic-domain pairing is not known. In a provocative model, catalytic-domain pairing was hypothesized to prevent ATP access to catalytic sites. If correct, kinase-activity would require catalytic-domain pair separation. Simultaneous homo-FRET and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to detect structural changes correlated with kinase activation under physiological conditions. Saturating Ca2+/CaM triggered Threonine-286 autophosphorylation and a large increase in CaMKII holoenzyme hydrodynamic volume without any appreciable change in catalytic-domain pair proximity or subunit stoichiometry. An alternative hypothesis is that two appropriately positioned Threonine-286 interaction-sites (T-sites), each located on the catalytic-domain of a pair, are required for holoenzyme interactions with target proteins. Addition of a T-site ligand, in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, elicited a large decrease in catalytic-domain homo-FRET, which was blocked by mutating the T-site (I205K). Apparently catalytic-domain pairing is altered to allow T-site interactions.},

  abstract = {The terminals of axons of dentate gyrus granule cells are known as 'mossy fibres'. Large mossy fibre boutons (MFBs) contact pyramidal cells in area CA3 of the hippocampus, whereas small terminals and filopodial extensions from MFBs target GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons.Several properties distinguish the excitatory mossy fibre–pyramidal synapse from other synapses in the CNS, including low basal release probability, pronounced frequency facilitation and a lack of NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) involvement in long-term potentiation (LTP).Adenosine acting on presynaptic A1 adenosine receptors contributes to the low initial release probability at the mossy fibre–pyramidal cell synapse. Synaptically released glutamate can mediate negative and positive feedback by acting on presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and kainate receptors (KARs), respectively, depending on the frequency at which the synapse is activated.Controversy surrounds the mechanism of LTP induction at the mossy fibre–pyramidal cell synapse, which does not depend on postsynaptic NMDAR activation. Whether postsynaptic Ca2+ influx has a role in mossy fibre LTP remains open to question, but there is strong evidence for an involvement of presynaptic Ca2+ channels. Presynaptic mGluRs and KARs might have a role in, but are not essential for, the induction of LTP at mossy fibre–pyramidal cell synapses.The expression of mossy fibre LTP is presynaptic, due to an increase in transmitter release. Entry of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal is proposed to directly activate adenylyl cyclase AC1 and AC8, resulting in a rise in cyclic AMP that is necessary and sufficient for mossy fibre LTP.Long-term depression (LTD) at mossy fibre–pyramidal cell synapses is thought to involve a reversal of the presynaptic processes that underlie LTP, although other forms of LTD might be expressed.Mossy fibre–interneuron synapses show a range of short-term responses to repetitive stimulation, from pronounced depression to modest facilitation. Glutamate released at these synapses can activate Ca2+-permeable (CP) or Ca2+-impermeable (CI) postsynaptic AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs).Early studies failed to show LTP at mossy fibre–interneuron synapses, but more recent studies indicate that this form of plasticity can be induced. CP-AMPAR synapses show NMDAR-independent LTD, which seems to be expressed as a presynaptic decrease in neurotransmitter release, whereas CI-AMPAR synapses show robust, NMDAR-dependent LTD, expressed postsynaptically as a downregulation of AMPARs.The study of hippocampal mossy fibre synapses has revealed a host of intriguing mechanisms by which synaptic strength can be controlled, and it seems likely that these synapses have only just begun to reveal their many secrets.},

The collective literature impels us to propose a relatively simple model for synaptic memory involving the following steps that drive the process: 1) Ca2+ entry through N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates CaMKII. 2) CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation resulting in constitutive, Ca2+-independent activity and exposure of a binding site for the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B. 3) Active CaMKII translocates to the postsynaptic density (PSD) and binds to the cytoplasmic C-tail of GluN2B. 4) The CaMKII-GluN2B complex initiates a structural rearrangement of the PSD that may involve liquid-liquid phase separation. 5) This rearrangement involves the PSD-95 scaffolding protein, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), and their transmembrane AMPAR-regulatory protein (TARP) auxiliary subunits, resulting in an accumulation of AMPARs in the PSD that underlies synaptic potentiation. 6) The stability of the modified PSD is maintained by the stability of the CaMKII-GluN2B complex. 7) By a process of subunit exchange or interholoenzyme phosphorylation CaMKII maintains synaptic potentiation in the face of CaMKII protein turnover.

  abstract = {In this paper, I investigate how the development of ethics and methods in beyond human and posthuman research have largely been ignored within institutional ethical frameworks. Specifically, I argue that the ethical review process for research needs critical consideration in light of emerging multispecies methodologies. The inclusion and consideration of animals in geography should go further than “bringing animals in” to the discipline; instead they must seek to rethink geographical theory as with and for non-humans. The ethics, politics, and practices of animals’ inclusion in research have been differentially attended to across geographical scholarship. To do this, I investigate how institutional ethical review operates as a disciplining and shaping tool in the neoliberal university. In doing so, I contend that ethical review processes shape the narratives and structures of what kinds of research are possible for not only animal geographers, but across the discipline. I then explore how multispecies research specifically is affected by and can affect institutional ethical review, revealing how these processes fall short against the heightened backdrop of species difference. Where posthumanist ethics is in tension with institutional ethical frameworks, I argue that ethical approval does not necessarily indicate that researchers have successfully grappled with complex moral dilemmas. Particularly, the acquiring of ethical approval prioritises outmoded forms of knowledge that prioritise homogenised ethical and methodological practice over ethical innovation and questioning. Finally, I offer three propositions drawing on posthumanist ethics and informed by innovative and exploratory multispecies research: the inclusion of animals as participants in research; the reimagination of multispecies ethical and methodological practice; and the reform of institutional ethical review processes. By exploring how radical ethics might be mobilised in multispecies research, I argue that we can further geographical theory and practice to reconfigure who matters as a geographical and ethical subject.},

However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using single-particle tracking of AMPARs, we show that CaMKII activation and postsynaptic translocation induce the synaptic trapping of AMPARs diffusing in the membrane. AMPAR immobilization requires both phosphorylation of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin and its binding to PDZ domain scaffolds. It does not depend on the PDZ binding domain of GluA1 AMPAR subunit nor its phosphorylation at Ser831. Finally, CaMKII-dependent AMPAR immobilization regulates short-term plasticity. Thus, NMDA-dependent Ca(2+) influx in the post-synapse triggers a CaMKII- and Stargazin-dependent decrease in AMPAR diffusional exchange at synapses that controls synaptic function.},

More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of Ca2+ signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over Ca2+ signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed in vivo. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.

  abstract = {CA1 pyramidal cells receive glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex through the perforant path (PP) and from CA3 through Schaffer collaterals (SC). The PP input terminates in the stratum lacunosum moleculare ∼300 μm from the cell body, whereas SC synapses have a more proximal location in the stratum radiatum. We compared the properties of AMPA- and NMDA-mediated transmission at these two inputs. The AMPA-mediated components have linear voltage dependence in both inputs. The reversal potential in the PP is only slightly more positive than in the SC, indicating that distal membrane voltage could be effectively set. The NMDA-mediated responses in the two pathways, however, are very different. The PP exhibits inward rectification, as evidenced by very low outward currents. The rectification persists in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. It cannot be attributed to clamping problems, because large outward AMPA currents can be observed even when conditions are modified to have the AMPA currents kinetically match the NMDA currents. Thus, it appears that the PP NMDA channels have novel properties. A second difference between the PP and SC pathways is that the PP has a larger NMDA/AMPA charge ratio. This difference could be observed under many conditions, including block of all voltage-dependent conductances and elimination of the negative resistance of NMDA channels by removing extracellular Mg2+. The difference in ratio thus cannot be attributed to regenerative currents. The higher NMDA component of the distal PP synapses could help to make these synapses more powerful under depolarizing conditions.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA1 synapses has been extensively studied, but the mechanisms responsible for its expression remain unresolved. We tested a hypothesis that there are multiple, developmentally regulated expression mechanisms by directly comparing LTP in hippocampal slices obtained from rats of two ages. At postnatal day 12 (P12), LTP was fully accounted for by an increase in potency (mean amplitude of responses excluding failures). This was associated with either an increase in AMPA receptor single-channel conductance (γ) or no change in γ, suggesting an increase in the number of AMPA receptors. At P6, LTP was explained by an additional two mechanisms. In the majority of neurons, LTP was associated with an increase in success rate and a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation. In the remaining neurons, LTP was attributable to an increase in potency. However, in contrast to P12 neurons, the potency increase was associated with a decrease in γ, suggesting the insertion of receptors with lower γ. We conclude that there are multiple expression mechanisms for LTP at CA1 synapses that are developmentally regulated. These findings suggest that a single class of synapse uses a number of different molecular mechanisms to produce long-term changes in synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {The calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a dodecameric holoenzyme important for encoding memory. Its activation, triggered by binding of calcium-calmodulin, persists autonomously after calmodulin dissociation. One (receiver) kinase captures and subsequently phosphorylates the regulatory domain peptide of a donor kinase forming a chained dimer as the first stage of autonomous activation. Protein dynamics simulations examined the conformational changes triggered by dimer formation and phosphorylation, aimed to provide a molecular rationale for human mutations that result in learning disabilities. Ensembles generated from X-ray crystal structures were characterized by network centrality and community analysis. Mutual information related collective motions to local fragment dynamics encoded with a structural alphabet. Implicit solvent tCONCOORD conformational ensembles revealed the dynamic architecture of inactive kinase domains was co-opted in the activated dimer but the network hub shifted from the nucleotide binding cleft to the captured peptide. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) showed nucleotide and substrate binding determinants formed coupled nodes in long-range signal relays between regulatory peptides in the dimer. Strain in the extended captured peptide was balanced by reduced flexibility of the receiver kinase C-lobe core. The relays were organized around a hydrophobic patch between the captured peptide and a key binding helix. The human mutations aligned along the relays. Thus, these mutations could disrupt the allosteric network alternatively, or in addition, to altered binding affinities. Non-binding protein sectors distant from the binding sites mediated the allosteric signalling; providing possible targets for inhibitor design. Phosphorylation of the peptide modulated the dielectric of its binding pocket to strengthen the patch, non-binding sectors, domain interface and temporal correlations between parallel relays. These results provide the molecular details underlying the reported positive kinase cooperativity to enrich the discussion on how autonomous activation by phosphorylation leads to long-term behavioural effects., Protein kinases play central roles in intracellular signalling. Auto-phosphorylation by bound nucleotide typically precedes phosphate transfer to multiple substrates. Protein conformational changes are central to kinase function, altering binding affinities to change cellular location and shunt from one signal pathway to another. In the brain, the multi-subunit kinase, CaMKII is activated by calcium-calmodulin upon calcium jumps produced by synaptic stimulation. Auto-transphosphorylation of a regulatory peptide enables the kinase to remain activated and mediate long-term behavioural effects after return to basal calcium levels. A database of mutated residues responsible for these effects is difficult to reconcile solely with impaired nucleotide or substrate binding. Therefore, we have computationally generated interaction networks to map the conformational plasticity of the kinase domains where most mutations localize. The network generated from the atomic structure of a phosphorylated dimer resolves protein sectors based on their collective motions. The sectors link nucleotide and substrate binding sites in self-reinforcing relays between regulatory peptides. The self-reinforcement is strengthened by phosphorylation consistent with the reported positive cooperativity of kinase activity with calcium-calmodulin concentration. The network gives a better match with the mutations and, in addition, reveals target sites for drug development.},

It subsequently delineates how β2 adrenergic receptor (β2 AR) signaling via adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP‐dependent protein kinase PKA is organized within nanodomains. Here, we discuss targeting of β2 AR, adenylyl cyclase, and PKA to defined signaling complexes at postsynaptic sites, i.e., AMPARs and the L‐type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2, and other subcellular surface localizations, the role of A~kinase anchor proteins, the physiological relevance of the spatial restriction of corresponding signaling, and their interplay with signal transduction by the Ca2+‐ and calmodulin‐dependent kinase CaMKII. How localized and specific signaling by cAMP occurs is a central cellular question. The dendritic spine constitutes an ideal paradigm for elucidating the dimensions of spatially restricted signaling because of their small size and defined protein composition.},

  abstract = {1. Whole-cell tight-seal recordings were obtained from visually identified pyramidal cells (PCs) and interneurones (INs) in the CA1 field of thin hippocampal slices from 13- to 23-day-old rats. The INs sampled were classified according to their location either in the molecular layer (M-INs) or in the oriens layer and alveus (OA-INs). PCs and INs differed in their mode of firing when depolarized by a prolonged current pulse. Whereas PCs fired a single action potential, most INs responded with non-accommodating high frequency spike firing. 2. In the presence of 1 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX), bath application of either 50 microM L-glutamate with 10 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or 2.5 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), induced a similar conductance increase in PCs and INs that was completely blocked by 200 microM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). The NMDA receptor-mediated currents reversed around 4 mV and exhibited an area of negative slope conductance at potentials more negative than -20 to -30 mV in the presence of 1-2 mM Mg2+. 3. Dual-component excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked in PCs and INs by stimulating afferent fibres close to the neurone. The NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSCs (NMDA EPSC) was isolated by adding 10 microM CNQX to block non-NMDA receptors. The NMDA EPSCs in all cell types reversed around 1.5 mV and were abolished by 50 microM APV. 4. In saline containing 1 mM Mg2+, the peak current-voltage (I-V) relationship of NMDA EPSCs in PCs and INs showed an area of negative slope conductance at voltages more negative than -20 to -30 mV. In nominally Mg(2+)-free saline, the peak I-V relation was linear over a much wider voltage range in both cell types. 5. The 10-90\% rise times of NMDA EPSCs at -60 mV ranged from 4.5 to 16 ms in PCs (mean 8.7 ms; n = 25) and in M-INs (mean 9.1 ms; n = 10). Their decay could be best fitted with the sum of two exponentials. The decay of NMDA EPSCs in PCs was significantly slower than that recorded in INs. The average fast (tau f) and slow (tau s) time constants of decay were, respectively, 66.5 and 353.9 ms in PCs, and 34.4 and 212.5 ms in M-INs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Author summary In the hippocampus, the dynamic fluctuation in size and strength of neuronal connections is thought to underlie learning and memory processes. These fluctuations, called synaptic plasticity, are in-part regulated by the protein calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). During synaptic plasticity, CaMKII becomes activated in the presence of calcium ions (Ca2+) and calmodulin (CaM), allowing it to interact enzymatically with downstream binding partners. Interestingly, activated CaMKII can phosphorylate itself, resulting in state changes that allow CaMKII to be functionally active independent of Ca2+/CaM. Phosphorylation of CaMKII at Thr-286/287 has been shown to be a critical component of learning and memory. To explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of CaMKII holoenzymes, we use a rule-based approach that reduces computational complexity normally associated with representing the wide variety of functional states that a CaMKII holoenzyme can adopt. Using this approach we observe regulatory mechanisms that might be obscured by reductive approaches. Our results newly suggest that CaMKII phosphorylation at Thr-286/287 is stabilized by a mechanism in which CaM structurally excludes phosphatase binding at that site.},

  abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a key mediator of long-term potentiation (LTP). Whereas acute intracellular injection of catalytically active CaMKII fragments saturates LTP (Lledo et al., 1995), an autonomously active form (T286D) of CaMKII holoenzyme expressed in transgenic mice did not saturate potentiation (Mayford et al., 1995). To better understand the role of the holoenzyme in the control of synaptic strength, we transfected hippocampal neurons with constructs encoding forms of CaMKII mimicking different phosphorylation states. Surprisingly, T286D not only failed to potentiate synaptic strength, but produced synaptic depression through an long-term depression (LTD)-like process. T305/T306 phosphorylation was critical for this depression because overexpression of the pseudophosphorylated form (T286D/T305D/T306D) caused depression that occluded LTD, and overexpression of an autonomous form in which T305/T306 could not be phosphorylated (T286D/T305A/T306A) prevented LTD (instead producing potentiation). Therefore, autonomous CaMKII can lead to either LTP or LTD, depending on the phosphorylation state of the control point, T305/T306.},

We construct a database from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. A survey of the principal investigators of a subset of these social science awards was also conducted. We report that very few social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much more common. The main analysis examines publication metrics that can be tied to the research data collected with NSF and NIH funding – total publications, primary publications (including PI), and secondary publications (non-research team). Multivariate models of count of publications suggest that data sharing, especially sharing data through an archive, leads to many more times the publications than not sharing data. This finding is robust even when the models are adjusted for PI characteristics, grant award features, and institutional characteristics.},

Scatchard analysis in the presence of glutamate and glycine showed this decline was due to a loss in the number [3H]MK-801 binding sites rather than a change in the affinity of the binding site. There was a highly significant age related reduction in the attenuation of [3H]MK-801 binding by zinc (P {$<$} 0.001). In foetal and neonatal cases up to 7 weeks of age spermidine behaved in an antagonistic manner, inhibiting rather than stimulating [3H]MK-801 binding, when alone or in the presence of glutamate and glycine. The changes in influence of glutamate, glycine, spermidine and zinc on [3H]MK-801 binding during development and aging were not due to other pre- or postmortem factors.

  abstract = {The study of patients with anterograde amnesia resulting from damage to the hippocampus and adjacent structures of the MTL has contributed enormously to our understanding of the organization of memory, of its relation to other aspects of cognition and behavior, and of its neural bases. Perhaps the most important principle to derive from the study of anterograde amnesia is that it is inaccurate to depict memory as a unitary domain of cognition, in the way that one might characterize vision or language. Indeed, a hallmark of a “pure” case of anterograde amnesia is the inability to encode (or learn) new information, despite relatively intact abilities to retrieve premorbid memories, to remember a small amount of information, such as a phone number, for tens of seconds or even longer, and to demonstrate the improvements that accompany repeated performance of routine behaviors or repeated exposure to stimuli. Also spared in anterograde amnesia is every other major domain of cognition–sensory perception, language comprehension and production, motor control, intelligence, and so on. Because this condition produces so circumscribed a deficit of cognition, it provides an interesting case with which to examine the relation of consciousness to memory versus other domains of cognition. The analysis in this chapter will begin with a review of the neurological exam and its implications, followed by the anatomical and physiological profile of the amnesic brain, followed by considerations of cognitive effects of damage to the MTL. It will end with a consideration of phenomenology.},

Here we study the conformational changes of the enzyme due to phosphorylation of some key residues that are believed to drive the transition from an inhibited to an active state; it is this active state the one associated with long-term potentiation. We found that the conformational changes could be explained in terms of three charged regions in the three main subdomains of the enzyme: the hub, linker, and kinase. The role of phosphorylation is to change the charge relation between them, turning on and off their interactions and switching between an attractive state (nonphosphorylated or inhibited) and a not attractive one (phosphorylated or active). We also show that phosphorylated subunits become less stable, and this could favor their release from the multimer, as has been already observed experimentally.},

These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are Hebbian input-specific mechanisms that rapidly increase or decrease AMPAR synaptic strength at specific inputs, and homeostatic plasticity that globally scales-up or -down AMPAR synaptic strength across many or even all inputs. Frequently, these changes in synaptic strength are also accompanied by a change in the subunit composition of AMPARs at the synapse due to the trafficking to and from the synapse of receptors lacking GluA2 subunits. These GluA2-lacking receptors are most often GluA1 homomeric receptors that exhibit higher single-channel conductance and are Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-permeable (CP-AMPAR). This review article will focus on the role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of GluA1 CP-AMPAR recruitment and removal from hippocampal synapses during synaptic plasticity with an emphasis on the crucial role of local signaling by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the Ca\textsuperscript{2+}calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) that is coordinated by the postsynaptic scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Dissociation of a complex of CaM and CKII(296-312), a peptide representing close to the minimum CaM-binding domain of the α subunit of CaM-kinase, exhibited a fast off-rate of 5.0 s\textsuperscript{−1}. This was similar to the off-rate of 1.1 s\textsuperscript{−1} for the dissociation of CaM from the nonphosphorylated form of CaM-kinase. In contrast, dissociation of CaM from either autophosphorylated CaM-kinase or peptide CKII(290-314) was extremely slow with apparent off-rates of about 3-9 × 10\textsuperscript{−5} s\textsuperscript{−1}. Along with information from the crystal structure of Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/CaM bound to CKII(290-314) (Meador, W. E., Means, A. R., and Quiocho, F. A. (1993) \emph{Science} 262, 1718-1721), our results suggest a model in which CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase induces a conformational change in the region of the CaM-binding domain which allows the formation of additional stabilizing interactions with CaM. We predict that this involves amino acids 293-298 in CaM-kinase. The possible consequences of these observations on the reversibility of CaM trapping in native CaM-kinase are discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {There has been considerable controversy about pre- versus postsynaptic expression of memory-related long-term potentiation (LTP), with corresponding disputes about underlying mechanisms. We report here an instance in male mice, in which both types of potentiation are expressed but in separate branches of the same hippocampal afferent. Induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus (DG) branch of the lateral perforant path (LPP) reduces paired-pulse facilitation, is blocked by antagonism of cannabinoid receptor type 1, and is not affected by suppression of postsynaptic actin polymerization. These observations are consistent with presynaptic expression. The opposite pattern of results was obtained in the LPP branch that innervates the distal dendrites of CA3: LTP did not reduce paired-pulse facilitation, was unaffected by the cannabinoid receptor blocker, and required postsynaptic actin filament assembly. Differences in the two LPP termination sites were also noted for frequency facilitation of synaptic responses, an effect that was reproduced in a two-step simulation by small adjustments to vesicle release dynamics. These results indicate that different types of glutamatergic neurons impose different forms of filtering and synaptic plasticity on their afferents. They also suggest that inputs are routed to, and encoded by, different sites within the hippocampus depending upon the pattern of activity arriving over the parent axon.},

We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.},

  abstract = {On theoretical grounds, the architecture of CA3 circuits seems to be well adapted for the rapid storage and retrieval of associative memories. This is thought to require plastic changes in the strength of specific synaptic contacts.Dentate gyrus cells provide sparse but powerful synaptic mossy fibre connections to CA3 pyramidal cells, which display a large dynamic range of presynaptic plasticity. This repertoire was recently extended to include postsynaptic plasticity of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), making these synapses competent for conventional long-term potentiation of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs.Local recurrent connectivity gives rise to the CA3 autoassociative network amenable to spike-timing dependent plasticity, which can be facilitated by heterosynaptic interactions.Local GABAergic loops control spike transfer at CA3 connections. GABAergic connectivity is subject to prominent structural and molecular plasticity in relation to memory encoding.Mice impaired in the plasticity of CA3–CA3 or dentate gyrus–CA3 connections show deficits in one-trial memory tasks. Nevertheless, a direct link between memory and functional plasticity of specific excitatory or inhibitory connections is still awaited.},

  abstract = {Our review focuses on the mechanisms which enable the late maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP; {$>$}3h), a phenomenon which is thought to underlie prolonged memory. About 20years ago we showed for the first time that the maintenance of LTP – like memory storage – depends on intact protein synthesis and thus, consists of at least two temporal phases. Here we concentrate on mechanisms required for the induction of the transient early-LTP and of the protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP. Our group has shown that the induction of late-LTP requires the associative activation of heterosynaptic inputs, i.e. the synergistic activation of glutamatergic and modulatory, reinforcing inputs within specific, effective time windows. The induction of late-LTP is characterized by novel, late-associative properties such as ‘synaptic tagging’ and ‘late-associative reinforcement’. Both phenomena require the associative setting of synaptic tags as well as the availability of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) and they are restricted to functional dendritic compartments, in general. ‘Synaptic tagging’ guarantees input specificity and thus the specific processing of afferent signals for the establishment of late-LTP. ‘Late-associative reinforcement’ describes a process where early-LTP by the co-activation of modulatory inputs can be transformed into late-LTP in activated synapses where a tag is set. Recent evidence from behavioral experiments, which studied processes of emotional and cognitive reinforcement of LTP, point to the physiological relevance of the above mechanisms during cellular and system's memory formation.},

In a discussion with four simulation modelling experts, however, a number of issues were raised that mean these benefits may not be obtainable. These issues include the motivation to develop reusable models, the validity and credibility of models to be reused, and the cost and time for familiarisation.

The crystal structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of CaMKII, determined at 1.8 A resolution, reveals an unexpected dimeric organization in which the calmodulin-responsive regulatory segments form a coiled-coil strut that blocks peptide and ATP binding to the otherwise intrinsically active kinase domains. A threonine residue in the regulatory segment, which when phosphorylated renders CaMKII calmodulin independent, is held apart from the catalytic sites by the organization of the dimer. This ensures a strict Ca2+ dependence for initial activation. The structure of the kinase dimer, when combined with small-angle X-ray scattering data for the holoenzyme, suggests that inactive CaMKII forms tightly packed autoinhibited assemblies that convert upon activation into clusters of loosely tethered and independent kinase domains.},

  abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a family of broad substrate specificity serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) protein kinases widely expressed in many tissues that is capable of mediating diverse functional responses depending on its cellular and molecular microenvironment. This review briefly summarises current knowledge on the structure and regulation of CaMKII and focuses on how the molecular environment, and interaction with binding partner proteins, can produce different populations of CaMKII in different cells, or in different subcellular locations within the same cell, and how these different populations of CaMKII can produce diverse functional responses to activation following an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. This review also explores the possibility that identifying and characterising the molecular interactions responsible for the molecular targeting of CaMKII in different cells in vivo, and identifying the sites on CaMKII and/or the binding proteins through which these interactions occur, could lead to the development of highly selective inhibitors of specific CaMKII-mediated functional responses in specific cells that would not affect CaMKII-mediated responses in other cells. This may result in the development of new pharmacological agents with therapeutic potential for many clinical conditions.},

  abstract = {How memories persist is a fundamental neurobiological question. The most commonly studied physiological model of memory is long-term potentiation (LTP). The molecular mechanisms of LTP can be divided into two phases: induction, triggering the potentiation; and maintenance, sustaining the potentiation over time. Although many molecules participate in induction, very few have been implicated in the mechanism of maintenance. Understanding maintenance, however, is critical for testing the hypothesis that LTP sustains memory storage in the brain. Only a single molecule has been found both necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP — the brain-specific, atypical PKC isoform, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMζ). Although full-length PKC isoforms respond to transient second messengers, and are involved in LTP induction, PKMζ is a second messenger-independent kinase, consisting of the independent catalytic domain of PKCζ, and is persistently active to sustain LTP maintenance. PKMζ is produced by a unique PKMζ mRNA, which is generated by an internal promoter within the PKCζ gene and transported to the dendrites of neurons. LTP induction increases new PKMζ synthesis, and the increased level of PKMζ then enhances synaptic transmission by doubling the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPAR) through GluR2 subunit-mediated trafficking of the receptors to the synapse. PKMζ mediates synaptic potentiation specifically during the late-phase of LTP, as PKMζ inhibitors can reverse established LTP when applied several hours after tetanization in hippocampal slices or 1 day after tetanization in vivo. These studies set the stage for testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of LTP maintenance sustains memory storage. PKMζ inhibition in the hippocampus after learning eliminates the retention of spatial memory. Once the PKMζ inhibitor has been eliminated, the memory is still erased, but new spatial memories can be learned and stored. Similar results are found for conditioned taste aversion when the inhibitor is injected in the insular neocortex. Thus PKMζ is the first molecule found to be a component of the long-term memory trace.},

There are still unsettled issues with respect to spine formation and plasticity: Are spines formed first, followed by synapse formation, or are synapses formed first, followed by emergence of a spine? What are the immediate and long-lasting changes in spine properties following exposure to plasticity-producing stimulation? Is spine volume/shape indicative of its function? These and other issues are addressed in this review, which highlights the complexity of molecular pathways involved in regulation of spine structure and function, and which contributes to the understanding of central synaptic interactions in health and disease.},

This activation is required for LTP induction, but the role of the kinase in the maintenance of LTP is less clear. Elucidating the mechanisms of maintenance may provide insights into the molecular processes that underlie the stability of stored memories. In this brief review, we will outline the criteria for evaluating an LTP maintenance mechanism. The specific hypothesis evaluated is that LTP is maintained by the complex of activated CaMKII with the NMDAR. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is substantial, but further experiments are required, notably to determine the time course and persistence of complex after LTP induction. Additional work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. It has been proposed by Frey and Morris that late LTP involves the setting of a molecular tag during LTP induction, which subsequently allows the activated synapse to capture the proteins responsible for late LTP. However, the molecular processes by which this leads to the structural growth that underlies late LTP are completely unclear. Based on known binding reactions, we suggest the first molecularly specific version of tag/capture hypothesis: that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, once formed, serves as a tag, which then leads to a binding cascade involving densin, delta-catenin, and N-cadherin (some of which are newly synthesized). Delta-catenin binds AMPA-binding protein (ABP), leading to the LTP-induced increase in AMPA channel content. The addition of postsynaptic N-cadherin, and the complementary increase on the presynaptic side, leads to a trans-synaptically coordinated increase in synapse size (and more release sites). It is suggested that synaptic strength is stored stably through the combined actions of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex and N-cadherin dimers. These N-cadherin pairs have redundant storage that could provide informational stability in a manner analogous to the base-pairing in DNA.},

The popular rule-based software tools BioNetGen and NFSim provide powerful modeling and simulation capabilities at the cost of learning a complex scripting language which is used to specify these models. Here, we introduce a modeling tool that combines new graphical rule-based model specification with existing simulation engines in a seamless way within the familiar Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling environment. A mathematical model can be built integrating explicit reaction networks with reaction rules. In addition to offering a large choice of ODE and stochastic solvers, a model can be simulated using a network free approach through the NFSim simulation engine.Availability and implementation: Available as VCell (versions 6.0 and later) at the Virtual Cell web site (http://vcell.org/).

  abstract = {Glutamate receptors are the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, responsible for mediating the vast majority of excitatory transmission in neuronal networks. The AMPA- and NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the fast synaptic responses, while metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are coupled to downstream signaling cascades that act on much slower timescales. These functionally distinct receptor sub-types are co-expressed at individual synapses, allowing for the precise temporal modulation of postsynaptic excitability and plasticity. Intriguingly, these receptors are differentially distributed with respect to the presynaptic release site. While iGluRs are enriched in the core of the synapse directly opposing the release site, mGluRs reside preferentially at the border of the synapse. As such, to understand the differential contribution of these receptors to synaptic transmission, it is important to not only consider their signaling properties, but also the mechanisms that control the spatial segregation of these receptor types within synapses. In this review, we will focus on the mechanisms that control the organization of glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane with respect to the release site, and discuss how this organization could regulate synapse physiology.},

Surprisingly, existing codes of scientific ethics have little to say about such choices. I propose that we can arrive at a set of ethical guidelines to govern scientists' presentation of information to policymakers by looking to bioethics: roughly, just as a clinician should aim to promote informed decision-making by patients, a scientist should aim to promote informed decision-making by policymakers. Though this may sound like a natural proposal, I show it offers guidance that conflicts with standard scientific practices. I conclude by considering one cost of the proposal: that it would prevent scientists from acting as advocates in a way that is currently common in certain fields. I accept that the proposal would restrict scientists' political advocacy rights, but argue that the benefits of adopting it—promoting democratic governance—justify the restriction.},

  abstract = {The traditional publication process delays dissemination of new research, often by months, sometimes by years. Preprint servers decouple dissemination of research papers from their evaluation and certification by journals, allowing researchers to share work immediately, receive feedback from a much larger audience, and provide evidence of productivity long before formal publication. Launched in 2013 as a non-profit community service, the bioRxiv server has brought preprint practice to the life sciences and recently posted its 64,000th manuscript. The server now receives more than four million views per month and hosts papers spanning all areas of biology. Initially dominated by evolutionary biology, genetics/genomics and computational biology, bioRxiv has been increasingly populated by papers in neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, and many other fields. Changes in journal and funder policies that encourage preprint posting have helped drive adoption, as has the development of bioRxiv technologies that allow authors to transfer papers easily between the server and journals. A bioRxiv user survey found that 42\% of authors post their preprints prior to journal submission whereas 37\% post concurrently with journal submission. Authors are motivated by a desire to share work early; they value the feedback they receive, and very rarely experience any negative consequences of preprint posting. Rapid dissemination via bioRxiv is also encouraging new initiatives that experiment with the peer review process and the development of novel approaches to literature filtering and assessment.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal cells contribute to memory by rapidly encoding information about the perceptual and behavioral structure of experience. This paper describes two complementary experimental approaches that illustrate two important mechanisms that confer these properties to hippocampal cells: (1) Enduring spatial memory and stable place fields each depend upon synaptic plasticity mechanisms that normally rely on the same NMDA-receptor mediated metabolic events as long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, hippocampal cells “learn” to encode information about the perceptual and behavioral structure of experiences. (2) Hippocampal cells encode the structure of experience and respond in a manner inconsistent with a spatial representation. Place fields are distributed heterogeneously in space, their locations are determined by non-geometric information, the population of active cells can indicate more than one location in space, and hippocampal cells encode discriminative stimuli independent of their spatial location. To the extent that the hippocampus encodes a map, it is more simply described as a memory map than a spatial map. Rather than computing spatial locations, the space it encodes is better described as a life or a problem space that encodes the history of experience into the relational structure of episodes.

  abstract = {Machine learning models are prone to biased decisions due to biases in the datasets they are trained on. In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique to create a fairer dataset for model training that could also lend itself to understanding the type of bias existing in the dataset i.e. if bias arises from a lack of representation for a particular group (sampling bias) or if it arises because of human bias reflected in the labels (prejudice based bias). Given a dataset involving a protected attribute with a privileged and unprivileged group, we create an "ideal world'' dataset: for every data sample, we create a new sample having the same features (except the protected attribute(s)) and label as the original sample but with the opposite protected attribute value. The synthetic data points are sorted in order of their proximity to the original training distribution and added successively to the real dataset to create intermediate datasets. We theoretically show that two different notions of fairness: statistical parity difference (independence) and average odds difference (separation) always change in the same direction using such an augmentation. We also show submodularity of the proposed fairness-aware augmentation approach that enables an efficient greedy algorithm. We empirically study the effect of training models on the intermediate datasets and show that this technique reduces the two bias measures while keeping the accuracy nearly constant for three datasets. We then discuss the implications of this study on the disambiguation of sample bias and prejudice based bias and discuss how pre-processing techniques should be evaluated in general. The proposed method can be used by policy makers who want to use unbiased datasets to train machine learning models for their applications to add a subset of synthetic points to an extent that they are comfortable with to mitigate unwanted bias.},

In contrast to the multitude of protein kinases and the clear signal transduction pathways, relatively few protein phosphatases are known and their regulation is unclear. Among them, calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase (PP2B), is the best enzyme to unveil the phosphatase function, because it was shown to be the direct target for immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, which are powerful tools for understanding this function in diseases as well as in several tissues and organs. Although calcineurin has been found in the highest concentrations in brain, it has also been detected in many other mammalian tissues. Well characterized in T cell activation by analysing the transcription factor NFAT, the function of calcineurin, however, was less well understood in other tissues and organs. Since the mid-1990s, several novel functions of this phosphatase have been reported, revealing that it plays important roles as a multifunctional regulator under the direct regulation of calcium signaling},

Among its regulators, protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), a Ser/Thr phosphatase, appears to be critical in controlling CaMKII-dependent neuronal signaling. In postsynaptic densities (PSDs), CaMKII is required for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular process correlated with learning and memory. In response to Ca2+ elevation during hippocampal LTP induction, CaMKIIα, an isoform that translocates from the cytosol to PSDs, is activated through autophosphorylation at Thr286, generating autonomous kinase activity and a prolonged Ca2+/CaM-bound state. Moreover, PP1 inhibition enhances Thr286 autophosphorylation of CaMKIIα during LTP induction. By contrast, CaMKII nuclear import is regulated by Ser332 phosphorylation state. CaMKIIδ3, a nuclear isoform, is dephosphorylated at Ser332 by PP1, promoting its nuclear translocation, where it regulates transcription. In this review, we summarize physio-pathological roles of CaMKII/PP1 signaling in neurons. CaMKII and PP1 crosstalk and regulation of gene expression is important for neuronal plasticity as well as survival and/or differentiation.},

Since the first full description of  the phenomenon in 1973, exploration of the mechanisms underlying  LTP induction has been one of the most active areas of research  in neuroscience. Of principal interest to those who study LTP,  particularly in the mammalian hippocampus, is its presumed role  in the establishment of stable memories, a role consistent with  “Hebbian” descriptions of memory formation. Other  characteristics of LTP, including its rapid induction, persistence,  and correlation with natural brain rhythms, provide circumstantial  support for this connection to memory storage. Nonetheless, there  is little empirical evidence that directly links LTP to the storage of  memories. In this target article we review a range of cellular and  behavioral characteristics of LTP and evaluate whether they are  consistent with the purported role of hippocampal LTP in memory  formation. We suggest that much of the present focus on LTP reflects  a preconception that LTP is a learning mechanism, although  the empirical evidence often suggests that LTP is unsuitable for such  a role. As an alternative to serving as a memory storage device, we  propose that LTP may serve as a neural equivalent to an arousal or  attention device in the brain. Accordingly, LTP may increase in a  nonspecific way the effective salience of discrete external stimuli  and may thereby facilitate the induction of memories at distant  synapses. Other hypotheses regarding the functional utility of this  intensely studied mechanism are conceivable; the intent of this target  article is not to promote a single hypothesis but rather to stimulate  discussion about the neural mechanisms underlying memory storage and  to appraise whether LTP can be considered a viable candidate for such  a mechanism.},

  abstract = {The field of educating individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder has ever been rife with controversy regarding issues ranging from etiology and causation to effective intervention and education options. One such basis for controversy has been between humanism, and humanistic philosophical concepts, and its fundamental differences with behaviorism, and behavioristic philosophical concepts. These differences have long been debated, and the belief that the two orientations are generally mutually exclusive has been largely maintained. Recently, however, there has been some resurgence of interest in reconciling some of the fundamental humanistic and behavioristic tenets. Most of these discussions, however, center on specific interventional methodologies as its basis without delving more deeply into the underlying philosophical issues. This article will explore some fundamental humanistic concepts that ought to be reconciled in order for behaviorism to be considered a humanistic practice. While the notion that the possibility of reconciliation is maintained, the central argument maintains that much work needs to be done on the part of behaviorism both philosophically and methodologically in order for such reconciliation to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Molecular bistables are strong candidates for long-term information storage, for example, in synaptic plasticity. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) is a highly expressed synaptic protein which has been proposed to form a molecular bistable switch capable of maintaining its state for years despite protein turnover and stochastic noise. It has recently been shown that CaMKII holoenzymes exchange subunits among themselves. Here, we used computational methods to analyze the effect of subunit exchange on the CaMKII pathway in the presence of diffusion in two different micro-environments, the post synaptic density (PSD) and spine cytosol. We show that CaMKII exhibits multiple timescales of activity due to subunit exchange. Further, subunit exchange enhances information retention by CaMKII both by improving the stability of its switching in the PSD, and by slowing the decay of its activity in the spine cytosol. The existence of diverse timescales in the synapse has important theoretical implications for memory storage in networks., The brain stores memories by changing the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. Synapses that change their strength easily can quickly encode new information. But such synapses are also unstable. They tend to revert back to their original state and so struggle to retain information. By contrast, synapses that are slow to change their strength are slow to learn, but are good at remembering. The difference is a little like that between writing a message in wet sand versus carving it into stone. It is quick and easy to write on sand, but the resulting marks are temporary. Writing on stone is slow and difficult, but the results last far longer., The brain must strike a balance between how fast synapses can learn and how well they can retain that information. One molecule that helps with this is a synaptic protein called CaMKII. Each CaMKII molecule consists of multiple subunits and exists in either an active or inactive state. Experiments have shown that CaMKII molecules can swap subunits. But how does this affect memory?, Singh and Bhalla used a computer model to simulate subunit exchange between CaMKII molecules. The results revealed that when active CaMKII molecules swap subunits, synapses become better at retaining information. However, when inactive CaMKII molecules swap subunits, synapses do not become better at encoding information. Subunit exchange by CaMKII thus helps synapses stabilize existing memories, rather than form new ones. This makes it easier for the brain to retain stored information despite threats to stability such as the turnover of proteins., A better knowledge of how the brain balances quick learning and slow forgetting may help us to better understand brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (in which patients struggle to remember), and post-traumatic stress disorder (in which patients struggle to forget). Biological memory networks can also inspire artificial memory systems. Damaging a few components of a computer memory can erase all the stored information. By contrast, the brain loses many neurons every day without suffering the same catastrophic failure. Mimicking such fault tolerance in an artificial system would be highly valuable for storing critical memories.},

Here we present the first site-directed mutagenesis study on the dissociation of the high affinity complex between CaM and full-length CaM kinase II. We measured dissociation kinetics of CaM and CaM kinase II proteins by using a fluorescently modified CaM that is sensitive to binding to target proteins. In low [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}], the phosphorylated mutant kinase F293A and the CaM mutant E120A/M124A exhibited deficient trapping compared with wild-type. In high [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}], the CaM mutations E120A, M124A, and E120A/M124A and the CaM kinase II mutations F293A, F293E, N294A, N294P, and R297E increased dissociation rate constants by factors ranging from 2.3 to 116. We have also identified residues in CaM and CaM kinase II that interact in the trapped state by mutant cycle-based analysis, which suggests that interactions between Phe\textsuperscript{293} in the kinase and Glu\textsuperscript{120} and Met\textsuperscript{124} in CaM specifically stabilize the trapped CaM-CaM kinase II complex. Our studies further show that Phe\textsuperscript{293} and Asn\textsuperscript{294} in CaM kinase II play dual roles, because they likely destabilize the low affinity state of CaM complexed to unphosphorylated kinase but stabilize the trapped state of CaM bound to phosphorylated kinase.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A fundamental neuroscience question is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or “tag” synapses as eligible for LTP. A likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Data also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKMζ synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I predicts that, for successful maintenance of LTP, either 1) PKMζ contributes to synaptic tagging, or 2) a low constitutive tag level persists during maintenance independent of PKMζ, or 3) maintenance of LTP is independent of tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKMζ activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However, we note data challenging the CaMKII feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activation of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to persistent elevation of PKMζ levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We conducted a meta-analysis to ascertain the strength and consistency of the association between study results and formal publication. Methods The Cochrane Methodology Register Database, MEDLINE and other electronic bibliographic databases were searched (to May 2009) to identify empirical studies that tracked a cohort of studies and reported the odds of formal publication by study results. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also examined for relevant studies. Odds ratios were used to measure the association between formal publication and significant or positive results. Included studies were separated into subgroups according to starting time of follow-up, and results from individual cohort studies within the subgroups were quantitatively pooled. Results We identified 12 cohort studies that followed up research from inception, four that included trials submitted to a regulatory authority, 28 that assessed the fate of studies presented as conference abstracts, and four cohort studies that followed manuscripts submitted to journals. The pooled odds ratio of publication of studies with positive results, compared to those without positive results (publication bias) was 2.78 (95\% CI: 2.10 to 3.69) in cohorts that followed from inception, 5.00 (95\% CI: 2.01 to 12.45) in trials submitted to regulatory authority, 1.70 (95\% CI: 1.44 to 2.02) in abstract cohorts, and 1.06 (95\% CI: 0.80 to 1.39) in cohorts of manuscripts. Conclusion Dissemination of research findings is likely to be a biased process. Publication bias appears to occur early, mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences or submission of manuscripts to journals.},

The 2010 document is reviewed in detail and the conclusion is drawn that it is not fit for purpose. Six wider issues raised by the FRE document are discussed: the consultation process by the ESRC was insufficient and the informed consent of the social science community was not obtained; the ethics creep involved will involve unnecessary bureaucratisation; the RECs will operate without expert discipline-specific knowledge using unethical generalist criteria; the overall effects long-term will be deleterious to the research base; the FRE document unacceptably ignores the professional associations and their research ethics guidelines; and the ESRC's system of the expert peer review of funding applications will be undermined.},

  abstract = {Multi-state modeling of biomolecules refers to a series of techniques used to represent and compute the behavior of biological molecules or complexes that can adopt a large number of possible functional states. Biological signaling systems often rely on complexes of biological macromolecules that can undergo several functionally significant modifications that are mutually compatible. Thus, they can exist in a very large number of functionally different states. Modeling such multi-state systems poses two problems: the problem of how to describe and specify a multi-state system (the "specification problem") and the problem of how to use a computer to simulate the progress of the system over time (the "computation problem"). To address the specification problem, modelers have in recent years moved away from explicit specification of all possible states and towards rule-based formalisms that allow for implicit model specification, including the κ-calculus, BioNetGen, the Allosteric Network Compiler, and others. To tackle the computation problem, they have turned to particle-based methods that have in many cases proved more computationally efficient than population-based methods based on ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, or the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm. Given current computing technology, particle-based methods are sometimes the only possible option. Particle-based simulators fall into two further categories: nonspatial simulators, such as StochSim, DYNSTOC, RuleMonkey, and the Network-Free Stochastic Simulator (NFSim), and spatial simulators, including Meredys, SRSim, and MCell. Modelers can thus choose from a variety of tools, the best choice depending on the particular problem. Development of faster and more powerful methods is ongoing, promising the ability to simulate ever more complex signaling processes in the future.},

We find that blocking the NMDAr decreases the synchronization of FC- spontaneous activity and mediates differential modulation of FC rate-level functions such that low, and high threshold units are more likely to increase, and decrease, respectively, their maximum amplitudes. Three significant alterations in mean learning-rule profiles were identified: transitions from an initial Hebbian profile towards (1) an anti-Hebbian; (2) a suppressive profile; and (3) transitions from an anti-Hebbian to a Hebbian profile. FC units preserving their learning rules showed instead, NMDAr-dependent plasticity to unimodal acoustic stimulation, with persistent depression of tone-evoked responses changing to persistent enhancement following the NMDAr antagonist. These results reveal a crucial role of the NMDAr in mediating FC baseline activity and long-term plasticity which have important implications for signal processing and auditory pathologies related to maladaptive plasticity of dorsal cochlear nucleus circuitry.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus consists of two opposing forces: long-term potentiation (LTP), which strengthens synapses and long-term depression (LTD), which weakens synapses. LTP and LTD are associated with memory formation and loss, respectively. Synaptic plasticity is controlled at a molecular level by Ca2+-mediated protein signaling. Here, Ca2+ binds the protein, calmodulin (CaM), which modulates synaptic plasticity in both directions. This is because Ca2+-bound CaM activates both LTD-and LTP-inducing proteins. Understanding how CaM responds to Ca2+ signaling and how this translates into synaptic plasticity is therefore important to understanding synaptic plasticity induction. In this paper, CaM activation by Ca2+ and calmodulin binding to downstream proteins was mathematically modeled using differential equations. Simulations were monitored with and without theoretical knockouts and, global sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how Ca2+/CaM signaling occurred at various Ca2+ signals when CaM levels were limiting. At elevated stimulations, the total CaM pool rapidly bound to its protein binding targets which regulate both LTP and LTD. This was followed by CaM becoming redistributed from low-affinity to high-affinity binding targets. Specifically, CaM was redistributed away from LTD-inducing proteins to bind the high-affinity LTP-inducing protein, calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). In this way, CaMKII acted as a dominant affecter and repressed activation of opposing CaM-binding protein targets. The model thereby showed a novel form of CaM signaling by which the two opposing pathways crosstalk indirectly. The model also found that CaMKII can repress cAMP production by repressing CaM-regulated proteins, which catalyze cAMP production. The model also found that at low Ca2+ stimulation levels, typical of LTD induction, CaM signaling was unstable and is therefore unlikely to alone be enough to induce synaptic depression. Overall, this paper demonstrates how limiting levels of CaM may be a fundamental aspect of Ca2+ regulated signaling which allows crosstalk among proteins without requiring directly interaction.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Calcium influx through the \emph{N}-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) are critical events in certain forms of synaptic plasticity. We have previously shown that autophosphorylation of CaMKII induces high-affinity binding to the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (Strack, S., and Colbran, R. J. (1998) \emph{J. Biol. Chem.} 273, 20689–20692). Here, we show that residues 1290–1309 in the cytosolic tail of NR2B are critical for CaMKII binding and identify by site-directed mutagenesis several key residues (Lys\textsuperscript{1292}, Leu\textsuperscript{1298}, Arg\textsuperscript{1299}, Arg\textsuperscript{1300}, Gln\textsuperscript{1301}, and Ser\textsuperscript{1303}). Phosphorylation of NR2B at Ser\textsuperscript{1303} by CaMKII inhibits binding and promotes slow dissociation of preformed CaMKII·NR2B complexes. Peptide competition studies imply a role for the CaMKII catalytic domain, but not the substrate-binding pocket, in the association with NR2B. However, analysis of monomeric CaMKII mutants indicates that the holoenzyme structure may also be important for stable association with NR2B. Residues 1260–1316 of NR2B are sufficient to direct the subcellular localization of CaMKII in intact cells and to confer dynamic regulation by calcium influx. Furthermore, mutation of residues in the CaMKII-binding domain in full-length NR2B bidirectionally modulates colocalization with CaMKII after NMDA receptor activation, suggesting a dynamic model for the translocation of CaMKII to postsynaptic targets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We now report that CaMKII has a remarkable property, which is that activation of the holoenzyme triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, including unactivated ones, enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation of new subunits. We show, using a single-molecule TIRF microscopy technique, that the exchange process is triggered by the activation of CaMKII, and that exchange is modulated by phosphorylation of two residues in the calmodulin-binding segment, Thr 305 and Thr 306. Based on these results, and on the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that the phosphorylated regulatory segment of CaMKII interacts with the central hub of the holoenzyme and weakens its integrity, thereby promoting exchange. Our results have implications for an earlier idea that subunit exchange in CaMKII may have relevance for information storage resulting from brief coincident stimuli during neuronal signaling.},

The scientific value of animal studies strongly decreases if they are not sufficiently robust, if their questions have already been sufficiently addressed or if the results are selectively reported. Against this background, we argue that three guiding principles are missing, that is, Robustness, Registration and Reporting, all of which aim to safeguard and increase the scientific value of animal research. To establish a new 6R framework, we need a multistakeholder discourse to conceptualise the specific requirements of robustness, registration and reporting and to clarify responsibilities, competencies and legislation for auditing 6R compliance.},

We present a network model of AMPAR trafficking for adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which reproduces both LTP and LTD. We show that the induction of both LTP and LTD is regulated by the competition between exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPARs, which are mediated by the calcium-sensors synaptotagmin 1/7 (Syt1/7) and protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1), respectively. Our result indicates that recycling endosomes containing AMPAR are always ready for Syt1/7-dependent exocytosis of AMPAR at peri-synaptic/synaptic membranes. This is because molecular motor myosin Vb constitutively transports the recycling endosome toward the membrane in a Ca2+-independent manner.},

This review focusses on visual sensory LTP induced using repetitive visual stimulation, resulting in changes in the visually evoked response recorded at the scalp with EEG. Across 15 years of use and replication in humans several major paradigm variants for eliciting visual LTP have emerged. The application of different paradigms, and the broad implementation of visual LTP across different populations combines to provide a rich and sensitive account of Hebbian LTP, and potentially non-Hebbian plasticity mechanisms.

This study aims to use the machine-learning models and deep-learning networks to identify key features of eye movements in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) under specific visual tasks, thereby facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of AD. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3D) visuospatial memory task is designed to provide participants with visual stimuli while their eye-movement data are recorded and used to build an eye-tracking dataset. Then, we propose a novel deep-learning-based model for identifying patients with Alzheimer's Disease (PwAD) and healthy controls (HCs) based on the collected eye-movement data. The proposed model utilizes a nested autoencoder network to extract the eye-movement features from the generated fixation heatmaps and a weight adaptive network layer for the feature fusion, which can preserve as much useful information as possible for the final binary classification. To fully verify the performance of the proposed model, we also design two types of models based on traditional machine-learning and typical deep-learning for comparison. Furthermore, we have also done ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each module of the proposed network. Finally, these models are evaluated by four-fold cross-validation on the built eye-tracking dataset. The proposed model shows 85\% average accuracy in AD recognition, outperforming machine-learning methods and other typical deep-learning networks.}

  abstract = {Understanding relationships between heart failure and arrhythmias, important causes of suffering and sudden death, remains an unmet goal for biomedical researchers and physicians. Evidence assembled over the past decade supports a view that activation of the multifunctional Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) favors myocardial dysfunction and cell membrane electrical instability. CaMKII activation follows increases in intracellular Ca2+ or oxidation, upstream signals with the capacity to transition CaMKII into a Ca2+ and calmodulin-independent constitutively active enzyme. Constitutively active CaMKII appears poised to participate in disease pathways by catalyzing the phosphorylation of classes of protein targets important for excitation–contraction coupling and cell survival, including ion channels and Ca2+ homeostatic proteins, and transcription factors that drive hypertrophic and inflammatory gene expression. This rich diversity of downstream targets helps to explain the potential for CaMKII to simultaneously affect mechanical and electrical properties of heart muscle cells. Proof-of-concept studies from a growing number of investigators show that CaMKII inhibition is beneficial for improving myocardial performance and for reducing arrhythmias. We review the molecular physiology of CaMKII and discuss CaMKII actions at key cellular targets and results of animal models of myocardial hypertrophy, dysfunction, and arrhythmias that suggest CaMKII inhibition may benefit myocardial function while reducing arrhythmias.},

It is not known how LTP relates to memory although there is considerable evidence for the hypothesis that hippocampal LTP is involved in memory. Regardless, it is the best understood example of long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), and it is a model for how long-lasting memory-associated changes are likely to occur in the CNS. Understanding LTP will yield valid insights into the mechanisms of plasticity that underlie learning and memory in the brain. The bona fide changes in neuronal connections that occur in vivo may or may not be identical to LTP as it is presently studied in the laboratory, but this does not diminish its utility as a cellular model system for studying lasting neuronal change in the mammalian CNS.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) can be defined as a long-lasting change in output in response to a transient input. The persistence of this effect is demonstrated to extend many hours in vitro and several weeks in vivo. It is not known how LTP relates to memory although there is considerable evidence for the hypothesis that hippocampal LTP is involved in memory. Regardless, it is the best understood example of long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), and it is a model for how long-lasting memory-associated changes are likely to occur in the CNS. Understanding LTP will yield valid insights into the mechanisms of plasticity that underlie learning and memory in the brain. The bona fide changes in neuronal connections that occur in vivo may or may not be identical to LTP as it is presently studied in the laboratory, but this does not diminish its utility as a cellular model system for studying lasting neuronal change in the mammalian CNS.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Much attention has been given to develop AD treatments based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis; however, none of these drugs had good efficacy at improving cognitive functions in AD patients suggesting that Aβ might not be the disease origin. Thus, there are urgent needs for the development of new therapies that target on the proximal cause of AD. Cellular calcium (Ca2+) signals regulate important facets of neuronal physiology. An increasing body of evidence suggests that age-related dysregulation of neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis may play a proximal role in the pathogenesis of AD as disrupted Ca2+ could induce synaptic deficits and promote the accumulation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Given that Ca2+ disruption is ubiquitously involved in all AD pathologies, it is likely that using chemical agents or small molecules specific to Ca2+ channels or handling proteins on the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles to correct neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation could open up a new approach to AD prevention and treatment. This review summarizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ dysregulation with AD pathologies and discusses the possibility of correcting neuronal Ca2+ disruption as a therapeutic approach for AD.},

  abstract = {Recent structural information on ligand-gated glutamate receptors and newly-discovered clinical uses for NMDA receptor antagonists has renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms of drug action at these receptors. Although the voltage-dependence and calcium permeability of NMDA receptors are well-studied, the mechanisms affecting the time course of synaptic NMDA receptor activation may be of more therapeutic value by serving as a rheostat for the total synaptic response. The NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC time course has been thought of as a fixed parameter based simply on receptor subunit composition as variably constrained by anatomical and developmental expression patterns, albeit subject to modification by kinetic behaviors such as modal gating. However, the EPSC time course also can be manipulated by endogenous and exogenous ligands. In this commentary we discuss insights into the in situ composition and kinetic behavior of synaptic NMDA receptors and propose new opportunities to target modulatory sites on NMDA receptors and to develop useful therapeutics. The emerging data on the atomic structure of NMDA receptors and knowledge of the kinetics of native receptors in neurons provide a roadmap in this regard.

  abstract = {By definition, learning is the acquisition of new informa­tion, whereas memory is the retention of acquired informa­tion. The ability to learn and to remember is one of the most fun­damental features of the brain. Memory is often classified temporally: short-term memory has a time course of seconds to hours, whereas long-term memory has a time course of weeks, months, or years. The basis for temporal division of the memory process is revealed by several observations that newly formed short-term memories are more vulnerable to interferences and disruptions. One fundamental goal of neuroscience is to understand the organizing principles and the neural network mechanisms by which the brain encodes and processes information in real time. In single neuron studies, recorded activity of single neurons needs to be averaged over many trials or even using different animals in order to overcome its fir­ing variability, and to identify its event-related responses and encoding properties. However, the brain is unlikely to accom­plish its processing through many repetitions in order to seek out statistically meaningful results.},

Synaptic CaMKII accumulation is mediated via binding to the NMDA-receptor subunit GluN2B and is required for long-term potentiation (LTP). By contrast, long-term depression (LTD) instead requires specific suppression of this movement, which is mediated by competitive DAPK1 binding to GluN2B. We find here that DAPK1 localizes to synapses via two distinct mechanisms: basal localization requires F-actin, but retention of DAPK1 at synapses during LTD requires an additional binding mode, likely to GluN2B. While F-actin binding mediates DAPK1 enrichment at synapses, it is not sufficient to suppress synaptic CaMKII movement. However, it is a prerequisite that enables the additional LTD-specific binding mode of DAPK1, which in turn mediates suppression of the CaMKII movement. Thus, both modes of synaptic DAPK1 localization work together to regulate synaptic CaMKII localization and thereby synaptic plasticity.},

However, as we delineate here, the experimental evidence is surprisingly far from conclusive. All previous interventions inhibiting enzymatic CaMKII activity and LTP4–8 also interfere with structural CaMKII roles, in particular binding to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B9–14. Thus, we here characterized and utilized complementary sets of new opto-/pharmaco-genetic tools to distinguish between enzymatic and structural CaMKII functions. Several independent lines of evidence demonstrated LTP induction by a structural function of CaMKII rather than by its enzymatic activity. The sole contribution of kinase activity was autoregulation of this structural role via T286 autophosphorylation, which explains why this distinction has been elusive for decades. Directly initiating the structural function in a manner that circumvented this T286 role was sufficient to elicit robust LTP, even when enzymatic CaMKII activity was blocked.},

  abstract = {The role of adenosine 5‘-triphosphate (ATP) in the activation mechanism of α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) was investigated using the T286A non-autophosphorylatable mutant of αCaMKII. Characterization of the T286A-αCaMKII mutant revealed kcat = 0.06 ± 0.02 s-1 for the T286A mutant, a 6 (± 2)-fold lower value compared to wild-type αCaMKII with 100 μM smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) as substrate. MLC phosphorylation by the T286A mutant and wild-type αCaMKII was cooperative, with Hill coefficients 2.3 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.3, respectively. Km values for MLC were 96 ± 28 μM with T286A-αCaMKII and 49 ± 29 μM for wild-type αCaMKII. Thus, while the activity of αCaMKII was sensitive to mutation of the Thr286 residue to Ala, the mechanisms of the wild-type and T286A mutant enzyme appeared similar. Kd for Ca2+/calmodulin was 2-fold reduced to 40 nM compared to that of wild-type αCaMKII (75 nM). ATP induced a 9-fold stabilization of Ca2+/calmodulin binding to the T286A mutant enzyme. Fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic experiments revealed that two Ca2+/calmodulin−enzyme complexes were formed, the first, unaffected by ATP, with association and dissociation rate constants of 2 × 107 M-1 s-1 and 5 s-1, respectively, containing calmodulin in extended conformation. The second complex, in which calmodulin adopted a compact conformation, was formed with association rate constant 3 × 106 M-1 s-1 and dissociation at 0.15 s-1 in the absence and 0.015 s-1 in the presence of ATP. These data show that ATP is involved in the activation mechanism by forming two classes of Ca2+/calmodulin·αCaMKII·ATP complex. It is likely that only one of the complexes is on the activation pathway.},

  abstract = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are known for their role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we start by reviewing the early evidence for their role in LTP at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. We then discuss more recent evidence that NMDAR dependent synaptic plasticity at these synapses can be separated into mechanistically distinct components. An initial phase of the synaptic potentiation, which is generally termed short-term potentiation (STP), decays in an activity-dependent manner and comprises two components that differ in their kinetics and NMDAR subtype dependence. The faster component involves activation of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits whereas the slower component involves activation of GluN2B and GluN2D subunits. The stable phase of potentiation, commonly referred to as LTP, requires activation of primarily triheteromeric NMDARs containing both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. In new work, we compare STP with a rebound potentiation (RP) that is induced by NMDA application and conclude that they are different phenomena. We also report that NMDAR dependent long-term depression (NMDAR-LTD) is sensitive to a glycine site NMDAR antagonist. We conclude that NMDARs are not synonymous for either LTP or memory. Whilst important for the induction of LTP at many synapses in the CNS, not all forms of LTP require the activation of NMDARs. Furthermore, NMDARs mediate the induction of other forms of synaptic plasticity and are important for synaptic transmission. It is, therefore, not possible to equate NMDARs with LTP though they are intimately linked. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Brain and Memory.},

  abstract = {For decades, regulatory guidelines for safety assessment in rodents for drugs, chemicals, pesticides, and food additives with developmental neurotoxic potential have recommended a single test of learning and memory (L\&M). In recent years some agencies have requested two such tests. Given the importance of higher cognitive function to health, and the fact that different types of L\&M are mediated by different brain regions assessing higher functions represents a step forward in providing better evidence-based protection against adverse brain effects. Given the myriad of tests available for assessing L\&M in rodents this leads to the question of which tests best fit regulatory guidelines. To address this question, we begin by describing the central role of two types of L\&M essential to all mammalian species and the regions/networks that mediate them. We suggest that the tests recommended possess characteristics that make them well suited to the needs in regulatory safety studies. By brain region, these are (1) the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex for spatial navigation, which assesses explicit L\&M for reference and episodic memory and (2) the striatum and related structures for egocentric navigation, which assesses implicit or procedural memory and path integration. Of the tests available, we suggest that in this context, the evidence supports the use of water mazes, specifically, the Morris water maze (MWM) for spatial L\&M and the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) for egocentric/procedural L\&M. We review the evidentiary basis for these tests, describe their use, and explain procedures that optimize their sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the plasticity of dendritic spines. Calcium signals cause calcium-calmodulin to activate CaMKII, which leads to remodeling of the actin filament (F-actin) network in the spine. We elucidate the mechanism of the remodeling by combining computer simulations with protein array experiments and electron microscopic imaging, to arrive at a structural model for the dodecameric complex of CaMKII with F-actin. The binding interface involves multiple domains of CaMKII. This structure explains the architecture of the micrometer-scale CaMKII/F-actin bundles arising from the multivalence of CaMKII. We also show that the regulatory domain of CaMKII may bind either calmodulin or F-actin, but not both. This frustration, along with the multipartite nature of the binding interface, allows calmodulin transiently to strip CaMKII from actin assemblies so that they can reorganize. This observation therefore provides a simple mechanism by which the structural dynamics of CaMKII establishes the link between calcium signaling and the morphological plasticity of dendritic spines.},

  abstract = {It is well known that American culture is a dominant force at home and abroad; our exportation of everything from movies to junk food is a well-documented phenomenon. But is it possible America's most troubling impact on the globalizing world has yet to be accounted for? In Crazy Like Us, Ethan Watters reveals that the most devastating consequence of the spread of American culture has not been our golden arches or our bomb craters but our bulldozing of the human psyche itself: We are in the process of homogenizing the way the world goes mad.  America has been the world leader in generating new mental health treatments and modern theories of the human psyche. We export our psychopharmaceuticals packaged with the certainty that our biomedical knowledge will relieve the suffering and stigma of mental illness. We categorize disorders, thereby defining mental illness and health, and then parade these seemingly scientific certainties in front of the world. The blowback from these efforts is just now coming to light: It turns out that we have not only been changing the way the world talks about and treats mental illness -- we have been changing the mental illnesses themselves.  For millennia, local beliefs in different cultures have shaped the experience of mental illness into endless varieties. Crazy Like Us documents how American interventions have discounted and worked to change those indigenous beliefs, often at a dizzying rate. Over the last decades, mental illnesses popularized in America have been spreading across the globe with the speed of contagious diseases. Watters travels from China to Tanzania to bring home the unsettling conclusion that the virus is us: As we introduce Americanized ways of treating mental illnesses, we are in fact spreading the diseases.  In post-tsunami Sri Lanka, Watters reports on the Western trauma counselors who, in their rush to help, inadvertently trampled local expressions of grief, suffering, and healing. In Hong Kong, he retraces the last steps of the teenager whose death sparked an epidemic of the American version of anorexia nervosa. Watters reveals the truth about a multi-million-dollar campaign by one of the world's biggest drug companies to change the Japanese experience of depression -- literally marketing the disease along with the drug.  But this book is not just about the damage we've caused in faraway places. Looking at our impact on the psyches of people in other cultures is a gut check, a way of forcing ourselves to take a fresh look at our own beliefs about mental health and healing. When we examine our assumptions from a farther shore, we begin to understand how our own culture constantly shapes and sometimes creates the mental illnesses of our time. By setting aside our role as the world's therapist, we may come to accept that we have as much to learn from other cultures' beliefs about the mind as we have to teach.},

AI algorithms have the potential to analyse medical data, enhance diagnostic accuracy, personalise treatment plans and predict patient outcomes among other possibilities. With a surge in AI's popularity, its developments are outpacing policy and regulatory frameworks, leading to concerns about ethical considerations and collaborative development. Healthcare faces its own ethical challenges, including biased datasets, under-representation and inequitable access to resources, all contributing to mistrust in medical systems. To address these issues in the context of AI healthcare solutions and prevent perpetuating existing inequities, it is crucial to involve communities and stakeholders in the AI lifecycle. This article discusses four community-driven approaches for co-developing ethical AI healthcare solutions, including understanding and prioritising needs, defining a shared language, promoting mutual learning and co-creation, and democratising AI. These approaches emphasise bottom-up decision-making to reflect and centre impacted communities' needs and values. These collaborative approaches provide actionable considerations for creating equitable AI solutions in healthcare, fostering a more just and effective healthcare system that serves patient and community needs.},

  abstract = {The market for direct-to-consumer brain health products—including brain-training games, neurostimulation devices, and consumer electroencephalography (EEG) devices—is expected to top \$3 billion by 2020. While many direct-to-consumer neurotechnology products have come under scrutiny from scientists and regulators, one set of products—consumer EEG devices—have largely escaped scholarly and regulatory critique. While these products do not present overt safety risks, by claiming to provide individuals with “snapshots” of their own mental states, they present a subtle, and arguably more complex, set of ethical issues. In addition, consumer EEG companies often explicitly or implicitly rely on studies conducted in the field of neurofeedback, a domain in which almost all adequately controlled studies point to little more than an interesting placebo effect. This paper presents an initial critique of consumer EEG devices, focusing only on devices that are marketed directly to consumers for improving their well-being. We categorize the behavioral and wellness-related marketing claims made by consumer EEG companies, analyze the evidence base for such claims, and argue that the ethical and legal issues wrought by these devices deserve greater attention.},

  abstract = {The market for direct-to-consumer brain health products—including brain-training games, neurostimulation devices, and consumer electroencephalography (EEG) devices—is expected to top \$3 billion by 2020. While many direct-to-consumer neurotechnology products have come under scrutiny from scientists and regulators, one set of products—consumer EEG devices—have largely escaped scholarly and regulatory critique. While these products do not present overt safety risks, by claiming to provide individuals with “snapshots” of their own mental states, they present a subtle, and arguably more complex, set of ethical issues. In addition, consumer EEG companies often explicitly or implicitly rely on studies conducted in the field of neurofeedback, a domain in which almost all adequately controlled studies point to little more than an interesting placebo effect. This paper presents an initial critique of consumer EEG devices, focusing only on devices that are marketed directly to consumers for improving their well-being. We categorize the behavioral and wellness-related marketing claims made by consumer EEG companies, analyze the evidence base for such claims, and argue that the ethical and legal issues wrought by these devices deserve greater attention.},

  abstract = {Computational chemistry grew in a new era of "desktop modeling", which coincided with a growing demand for modeling software, especially from the pharmaceutical industry. Parameterization of models in computational chemistry is an arduous enterprise, and we argue that this activity leads, in this specific context, to tensions among scientists regarding the lack of epistemic transparency of parameterized methods and the software implementing them. We relate one flame war from the Computational Chemistry mailing List in order to assess in detail the relationships between modeling methods, parameterization, software and the various forms of their enclosure or disclosure. Our claim is that parameterization issues are a source of epistemic opacity and that this opacity is entangled in methods and software alike. Models and software must be addressed together to understand the epistemological tensions at stake.},

Physiological studies of these mice and parallel pharmacological experiments in wild-type mice reveal a novel, intermediate phase of LTP (I-LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This intermediate phase differs from E-LTP by requiring multiple trains for induction and in being dependent on PKA. It differs from L-LTP in not requiring new protein synthesis.

  abstract = {Some experts suggest that sedation of laboratory rodents with isoflurane before euthanasia with carbon dioxide (CO2) is a humane alternative to euthanasia with CO2 alone, but little research has compared aversion with these agents. Albino rats were tested in a light–dark box where they had the choice between remaining in a dark compartment filling with isoflurane or CO2, or escaping to a lit compartment. Experiment 1 validated the procedure by confirming that rats responded to agent and light intensity. In experiment 2, 9/16 and 0/16 rats remained in the dark compartment until recumbent when initially exposed to isoflurane and CO2, respectively. In experiment 3, more rats remained in the dark compartment until recumbent during initial (10/16) versus re-exposure (1/16) to isoflurane. These results indicate that initial exposure to CO2 is more aversive than isoflurane, and that re-exposure to isoflurane is more aversive than initial exposure. We conclude that sedation with isoflurane is a refinement over euthanasia with CO2 alone for rats that have not been previously exposed to inhalant anaesthetics.},

  abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase that transmits calcium signals in various cellular processes. CaMKII is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) through a direct binding mechanism involving a regulatory C-terminal α-helix in CaMKII. The Ca2+/CaM binding triggers transphosphorylation of critical threonine residues proximal to the CaM-binding site leading to the autoactivated state of CaMKII. The demonstration of its critical roles in pathophysiological processes has elevated CaMKII to a key target in the management of numerous diseases. The molecule KN-93 is the most widely used inhibitor for studying the cellular and in vivo functions of CaMKII. It is widely believed that KN-93 binds directly to CaMKII, thus preventing kinase activation by competing with Ca2+/CaM. Herein, we employed surface plasmon resonance, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize this presumed interaction. Our results revealed that KN-93 binds directly to Ca2+/CaM and not to CaMKII. This binding would disrupt the ability of Ca2+/CaM to interact with CaMKII, effectively inhibiting CaMKII activation. Our findings also indicated that KN-93 can specifically compete with a CaMKIIδ-derived peptide for binding to Ca2+/CaM. As indicated by the surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry data, apparently at least two KN-93 molecules can bind to Ca2+/CaM. Our findings provide new insight into how in vitro and in vivo data obtained with KN-93 should be interpreted. They further suggest that other Ca2+/CaM-dependent, non-CaMKII activities should be considered in KN-93–based mechanism-of-action studies and drug discovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Various forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are initiated through synapse-specific increases in Ca2+ that are generated through the activation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels or NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors.Many of the effects of Ca2+ on synaptic efficiency are mediated through the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), which mediates Ca2+ stimulation of several enzymes that are crucial for synaptic plasticity. The affinity of CaM for most of these proteins is increased when the concentration of free Ca2+ increases. Therefore, CaM mediates activity-dependent stimulation of a family of enzymes that are important for synaptic plasticity.The unique regulatory properties of CaM allow various target enzymes with different Ca2+ sensitivities to be stimulated and to show varying degrees of positive cooperativity.Several novel CaM-binding proteins, including neuromodulin and neurogranin, localize and control the levels of free CaM in neurons. These IQ domain-containing proteins bind CaM with higher affinity in the absence of Ca2+ compared with in the presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, neuromodulin and neurogranin can be phosphorylated at sites within an IQ domain, which is also the CaM-binding domain. Consequently, activity-dependent Ca2+ increases the release of CaM from neuromodulin and neurogranin.Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a CaM-stimulated kinase, has a crucial role in several forms of LTP. CaMKII might contribute to LTP by augmenting the activity of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors and stimulating dendritic translation. CaMKIV phosphorylates the CREB (cAMP responsive element (CRE)-binding protein) binding protein (CBP), which is a necessary event for Ca2+ stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription and heterosynaptic late-phase LTP.Calcineurin, a CaM-stimulated protein phosphatase, is thought to catalyse the dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors, an important event in LTD.The CaM-stimulated adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC8 are thought to contribute to LTP by coupling activity-dependent Ca2+ increases to elevated cAMP. This cAMP signal activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and enhances the activity of AMPA. In addition, cAMP increases ERK/MAPK activity, a crucial activity for L-LTP.},

  abstract = {Regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is likely based on an auto-inhibitory mechanism in which a segment of the kinase occupies the catalytic site in the absence of calmodulin. We analyze potential auto-inhibitory associations by employing charge reversal and hydrophobic-to-charged residue mutagenesis. We identify interacting amino acid pairs by using double mutants to test which modification in the catalytic domain complements a given change in the auto-inhibitory domain. Our studies identify the core pseudosubstrate sequence (residues 297–300) but reveal that distinct sequences centered about the autophosphorylation site at Thr-286 are involved in the critical auto-inhibitory interactions. Individual changes in any of the residues Arg-274, His-282, Arg-283, Lys-291, Arg-297, Phe-293, and Asn-294 in the auto-inhibitory domain or their interacting partners in the catalytic domain produces an enhanced affinity for calmodulin or generates a constitutively active enzyme. A structural model of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that incorporates these interactions shows that Thr-286 is oriented inwardly into a hydrophobic channel. The model explains why calmodulin must bind to the auto-inhibitory domain in order for Thr-286 in that domain to be phosphorylated and why introduction of phospho-Thr-286 produces the important Ca2+-independent state of the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are morphological specializations that receive synaptic inputs and compartmentalize calcium. In spite of a long history of research, the specific function of spines is still not well understood. Here we review the current status of the relation between morphological changes in spines and synaptic plasticity. Since Cajal and Tanzi proposed that changes in the structure of the brain might occur as a consequence of experience, the search for the morphological correlates of learning has constituted one of the central questions in neuroscience. Although there are scores of studies that encompass this wide field in many species, in this review we focus on experimental work that has analyzed the morphological consequences of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. Over the past two decades many studies have demonstrated changes in the morphology of spines after LTP, such as enlargements of the spine head and shortenings of the spine neck. Biophysically, these changes translate into an increase in the synaptic current injected at the spine, as well as shortening of the time constant for calcium compartmentalization. In addition, recent online studies using time-lapse imaging have reported increased spinogenesis. The currently available data show a strong correlation between synaptic plasticity and morphological changes in spines, although at the same time, there is no evidence that these morphological changes are necessary or sufficient for the induction or maintenance of LTP. Still, they highlight once more how form and function go hand in hand in the central nervous system.},

  abstract = {Eugenic principles originated in the nineteenth century, along with the related subject of racial hygiene. Eugenics became popular globally, not just in Germany, and was seen as a solution to society’s problems of poverty, crime, and mental illness. Neuroscientists flocked to eugenics, but long before that they helped popularize scientific racism by espousing ideas about smaller skull sizes in so-called “inferior” races. Even famous neuroscientists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century became staunch eugenicists, including Forel, Möbius, Anton, Lundborg, Lennox, and Foster Kennedy. Thus, it isn’t surprising that leading up to the Nazi era, neuroscientists were some of the biggest proponents of forced sterilization and even euthanasia programs as negative eugenics measures to rid society of unwanted elements, including neurologic and psychiatric patients who were seen as “burdens.” Notably, not all neuroscientists believed in eugenic measures on these patients, with some calling for “exoneration of the feebleminded.”},

  abstract = {The use of data-intensive methods for tasks which impact peoples’ lives continues to accelerate. This has resulted in several high-profile, seemingly avoidable, ethical mistakes.  Despite this, those with the power to change how data science is developed can lack the incentives, training, or support, to properly consider the impacts of their work. This scrutiny is also not often provided by review boards, whose focus tends to be on the protection of human participants rather than downstream outcomes. Supporting data scientists and technical staff to consider worst-case scenarios, and facilitate discussions with ethics experts and those impacted by their methods, could allow us to work together across disciplinary boundaries to identify and avoid possible negative outcomes. A selected shared vocabulary could overcome two known barriers to such interdisciplinary conversations: a mismatched vocabulary and a lack of an accessible structure for discussions.    This paper presents the Data Hazards project, which contains a shared, controlled vocabulary of 11 data ethics issues, presented as ‘labels’ which represent potential negative outcomes of data science work.  Similarly to chemical hazard labels, the Data Hazards serve as a warning of a potential risk, and encourage adoption of appropriate safety measures.  The labels were co-created as an open-source project, where they will continue to evolve over time with input from various communities. In this paper we present version 1.0. We present the 11 current labels, each consisting of: an image, description, examples of when it applies, and crucially, safety precautions that provide concrete steps to address concerns. The project provides documentation for using these labels that supports technical decision-makers to consider the perspectives of a diverse audience on these issues, through workshops or asynchronously.  The ‘alpha’ set of Data Hazards were evaluated through a series of workshops, with participants (N=47). In these workshops participants saw a presentation on one of five data science projects and applied the labels to them before and after a structured reflective discussion. The projects covered a range of data science applications from data collection to natural language processing.    Overall, 94\% of participants found the labels useful, 92\% found the concepts clear, and 72\% thought that they were easy to apply to a real project. Most workshop participants (89\%) found the reflective discussion format useful, and we include reflections from two project owners on their experience of presenting their work.},

  abstract = {Hypertension is a major adverse effect of calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine, used clinically as immunosuppressants. Calcineurin inhibitor-induced hypertension (CIH) is linked to augmented sympathetic output from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). GluA2-lacking, Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) are a key feature of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, yet their role in CIH remains elusive. Here, we found that systemic administration of FK506 in rats significantly increased serine phosphorylation of GluA1 and GluA2 in PVN synaptosomes. Strikingly, FK506 treatment reduced GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in both synaptosomes and endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions from the PVN. Blocking CP-AMPARs with IEM-1460 induced a larger reduction of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (AMPAR-EPSC) amplitudes in retrogradely labelled, spinally projecting PVN neurons in FK506-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, FK506 treatment shifted the current–voltage relationship of AMPAR-EPSCs from linear to inward rectification in labelled PVN neurons. FK506 treatment profoundly enhanced physical interactions of α2δ-1 with GluA1 and GluA2 in the PVN. Inhibiting α2δ-1 with gabapentin, α2δ-1 genetic knockout, or disrupting α2δ-1–AMPAR interactions with an α2δ-1 C terminus peptide restored GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in the PVN and diminished inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in labelled PVN neurons induced by FK506 treatment. Additionally, microinjection of IEM-1460 or α2δ-1 C terminus peptide into the PVN reduced renal sympathetic nerve discharges and arterial blood pressure elevated in FK506-treated rats but not in vehicle-treated rats. Thus, calcineurin in the hypothalamus constitutively regulates AMPAR subunit composition and phenotypes by controlling GluA1/GluA2 interactions with α2δ-1. Synaptic CP-AMPARs in PVN presympathetic neurons contribute to augmented sympathetic outflow in CIH. Key points Systemic treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor increases serine phosphorylation of synaptic GluA1 and GluA2 in the PVN. Calcineurin inhibition enhances the prevalence of postsynaptic Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in PVN presympathetic neurons. Calcineurin inhibition potentiates α2δ-1 interactions with GluA1 and GluA2, disrupting intracellular assembly of GluA1/GluA2 heterotetramers in the PVN. Blocking Ca2+-permeable AMPARs or α2δ-1–AMPAR interactions in the PVN attenuates sympathetic outflow augmented by the calcineurin inhibitor.},
