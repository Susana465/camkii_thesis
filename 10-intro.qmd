# Introduction:

## What is this PhD about?

This PhD project weaves together multiple threads. The foundational thread of this PhD is rooted in a biological question: understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying memory in animals. In particular, I investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) interactions within the dendritic postsynaptic density. Changes in the function of these synaptic proteins have been implicated in a range of diseases and conditions, including age-related cognitive decline in human and non-human animals [@henstridge2016Synaptic; @li2020Higha] and neurodegenerative diseases [@foster2007Calciuma; @tong2018Calciuma]. Moreover, these changes have been shown to be implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, addiction, autism spectrum condition, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders [@robison2014Emerginga].

Additionally, alterations in synaptic strength, like Long-Term Depression (LTD) and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), involve diverse chemical pathways that have been used to explore the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008Dissecting]. In particular, studying learning and memory at the molecular level reveals that NMDAR and CaMKII, interacting with other proteins within dendritic spines, play a role in influencing dendritic spines' shape and function [@fink2002Molecular]. Studies using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment [@moyano2004NMDA, @zhou2007Interactions, @halt2012CaMKII]. 

To investigate these molecular processes, the project uses computational models to simulate molecular interactions. Experimental studies are increasingly complemented by computational models to aid in characterizing the spatiotemporal regulation of proteins of interest. Given the complexity and multiscale nature of biological systems, computational models play a crucial role in integrating experimental data and theoretical hypotheses. Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions. Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

A major emphasis in this PhD is placed on ensuring these models and the techniques used adhere to the principles of reproducibility and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. Another critical thread of this research, therefore, involves examining the ethical implications of the work carried out, particularly to identify potential biases and dangers that may be carried on. I use the Data Hazards framework to discuss the ethical implications of this PhD. This framework assigns hazard-like labels, similar to chemical warning labels, to highlight risks such as “danger of misuse” or “high environmental impact.” By doing so, I identify and address relevant ethical risks, implementing or suggesting appropriate safety precautions to mitigate them throughout the research process, from inception to conclusion. 

To provide a more comprehensive overview of this PhD, this introduction chapter will first explore the biological background relevant to the project, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms proposed to underlie memory and learning in animals. Secondly, I will introduce how and why I choose to simulate these molecular mechanisms using computational models. Finally, I will conclude the introduction by briefly discussing how the concept of Data Hazards ties all of it together and encapsulates the entire PhD.
