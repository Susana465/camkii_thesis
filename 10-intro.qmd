# Lay Summary:

## What is this PhD about?

This PhD project weaves together multiple threads, including biological questions as well as ethical ones. The foundational thread of this PhD is rooted in a biological question: understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying memory in animals. In particular, I investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of two molecules called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). 

These molecules are located inside neurons, and particularly they are found to have important functions in specialised structures within these neurons called dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are tiny, specialized compartments on neurons where critical communication between brain cells occurs. The interaction between NMDAR and CaMKII is known to be important for something known as Long Term Potentiation (LTP). LTP is important here because this mechanism is thought to be a crucial process where the connections between neurons, known as synapses, become stronger with repeated activation. This strengthening of synapses is widely considered a cellular basis for learning and memory.

CaMKII and NMDARs are part of a complex network of molecules that are interacting inside our neurons to enable LTP. But why focus on these two molecules specifically and not others? Although of course other molecules are important too, there is rising evidence that these two molecules and how they are interacting together has important functions at the molecular level when studying memory and learning. For example, studies using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment [@moyano2004NMDA, @zhou2007Interactions, @halt2012CaMKII]. Additionally, changes in the function of these molecules have been implicated in a range of diseases and conditions, including age-related cognitive decline in human and non-human animals [@henstridge2016Synaptic; @li2020Higha] and neurodegenerative diseases [@foster2007Calciuma; @tong2018Calciuma]. Likewise, these changes have also been shown to be implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, addiction, autism spectrum condition, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders [@robison2014Emerginga].

NMDARs are positioned on the surface of neurons. When certain signals come in, these receptors open and let calcium flow into the cell. This calcium acts as a signal for a plethora of molecular cascades to happen, which ultimately lead to biochemical changes in neurons. CaMKII is inside the neuron and responds to this calcium signal. When activated by calcium, CaMKII triggers a series of changes inside the cell that strengthen the connections between neurons. This strengthening is a key part of how the brain stores memories. 

CaMKII is a dodecamer, meaning it’s made up of twelve subunits, and has important properties thought to mediate LTP. One such property is its ability to undergo autophosphorylation, allowing it to remain active long after the initial signal has passed. Additionally, CaMKII can bind to NMDARs, and this binding has been suggested to be key for mediating LTP as well. 

Importantly, recent research has shown that it is this interaction between CaMKII and NDMARs that might be a minimal requirement for LTP [REFERENCES]. This means that by focusing on these essential molecular interactions —those between CaMKII and NMDARs— we can isolate the core mechanisms of memory formation without the added complexity of larger molecular networks. 

To investigate these molecular processes, the project employs computational models to simulate the interactions between molecules. A novel aspect of this research is the creation of a computer model that, for the first time, simulates CaMKII as a dodecamer in both time and space, while also visualizing its interactions with NMDARs within a 3D neuronal environment. Previous studies have modelled CaMKII as a dodecamer in 3D space and over time [REFERENCES], but they did not explore its direct interactions with NMDARs. This research is valuable because it allows us to make predictions about how CaMKII may interact with NMDARs as essential components for memory processes.

Experimental studies are increasingly supported by computer models like the one created in this PhD to help study the spatial and temporal regulation of specific proteins. Given the complexity and multiscale nature of biological systems, computational models play a crucial role in integrating experimental data and theoretical hypotheses. 

Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions. Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

A major emphasis in this PhD is placed on ensuring these models and the techniques used adhere to the principles of reproducibility and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. Another critical thread of this research, therefore, involves examining the ethical implications of the work carried out, particularly to identify potential biases and dangers that may be carried on. I use the Data Hazards framework to discuss the ethical implications of this PhD. This framework assigns hazard-like labels, similar to chemical warning labels, to highlight risks such as “danger of misuse” or “high environmental impact.” By doing so, I identify and address relevant ethical risks, implementing or suggesting appropriate safety precautions to mitigate them throughout the research process, from inception to conclusion.
