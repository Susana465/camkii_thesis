# Introduction:

## What is this PhD about?

This PhD project weaves together multiple threads. The foundational thread of this PhD is rooted in a biological question: understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying memory in animals. In particular, I investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) interactions within the dendritic postsynaptic density. Changes in the function of these synaptic proteins have been implicated in a range of diseases and conditions, including age-related cognitive decline in human and non-human animals [@henstridge2016Synaptic; @li2020Higha] and neurodegenerative diseases [@foster2007Calciuma; @tong2018Calciuma]. Moreover, these changes have been shown to be implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, addiction, autism spectrum condition, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders [@robison2014Emerginga].

Additionally, alterations in synaptic strength, like Long-Term Depression (LTD) and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), involve diverse chemical pathways that have been used to explore the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008Dissecting]. In particular, studying learning and memory at the molecular level reveals that NMDAR and CaMKII, interacting with other proteins within dendritic spines, play a role in influencing dendritic spines' shape and function [@fink2002Molecular]. Studies using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment [@moyano2004NMDA, @zhou2007Interactions, @halt2012CaMKII]. 

To investigate these molecular processes, the project uses computational models to simulate molecular interactions. Experimental studies are increasingly complemented by computational models to aid in characterizing the spatiotemporal regulation of proteins of interest. Given the complexity and multiscale nature of biological systems, computational models play a crucial role in integrating experimental data and theoretical hypotheses. Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions. Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

A major emphasis in this PhD is placed on ensuring these models and the techniques used adhere to the principles of reproducibility and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. Another critical thread of this research, therefore, involves examining the ethical implications of the work carried out, particularly to identify potential biases and dangers that may be carried on. I use the Data Hazards framework to discuss the ethical implications of this PhD. This framework assigns hazard-like labels, similar to chemical warning labels, to highlight risks such as “danger of misuse” or “high environmental impact.” By doing so, I identify and address relevant ethical risks, implementing or suggesting appropriate safety precautions to mitigate them throughout the research process, from inception to conclusion. 

To provide a more comprehensive overview of this PhD, this introduction chapter will first explore the biological background relevant to the project, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms proposed to underlie memory and learning in animals. Secondly, I will introduce how and why I choose to simulate these molecular mechanisms using computational models. Finally, I will conclude the introduction by briefly discussing how the concept of Data Hazards ties all of it together and encapsulates the entire PhD. 



## Computational Modelling
Modelling aims to describe elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements. A model should be detailed and precise enough to simulate the system's behavior on a computer. Living cells are complex, with biochemical processes organized across various compartments like the extracellular space, cytosol, plasma membrane, and organelles. These processes are multiscale, involving small-scale molecular interactions that lead to emergent, larger-scale cellular behaviors. Understanding these dynamic, multiscale processes requires appropriate mathematical tools to analyze and control the system's behavior, which can help understanding life and disease.

An important aim of modelling is to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by being precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in understanding. Our understanding of experimental observations in any system can be measured by how closely the simulations we create mimic the system's real behavior. Behaviours of computer executable models are at first compared and validated with experimental values. If at this stage inconsistency is found, it means that the assumptions, that represent our knowledge on the system, are at best incomplete, or that the interpretation of the experimental data is wrong. Models that  survive this initial validation can then be used to make predictions to be tested by experiments, as well to explore configurations of the system that are not easy to investigate by _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ experiments.  Creating predictive models can give opportunities for unprecedented control over the system. Modelling can provide valuable insights into the workings and general principles of organization of biological systems.

Using computational methods for studying biological mechanisms can offer many advantages, including considerable time and cost-efficient savings. Using computer models allows us to study the specific molecules in question, for example, with the ability of testing minimal requirements of very complex systems by just considering the molecules immediately influencing the phenomenon that is being studied. Of course this comes with the caveat that the whole system dynamics cannot be observed. Nevertheless, useful predictions can come out of these models to combine with wet lab research and a combination of both can be useful for creating predictions about biological phenomena. 

This project looks at biology at the level of protein-protein interactions and dynamics. It takes the view that looking at these dynamics is necessary if we want to understand emergent properties of these interactions. Therefore, modelling, simulation, and analysis of simulation outcomes are perfectly positioned for integration into the experimental cycle of cell/molecular biology. Although _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ experiments might still be needed to advance our understanding of biological processes, conducting in silico, or computer-simulated experiments can help guide the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space. This in turn can mean a reduction of repeated wet-lab experiments, meaning reduced suffering of non-human animals, in accordance with the “Replacement” R of the 3Rs framework @tannenbaum2015Russell.

### How do we model biochemical systems networks?

Biological and chemical systems can be described by networks of chemical reactions; in other words, the cascades of interactions between CaMKII with other molecules can be understood as a network of chemical reactions. And computational models of these reaction networks can be used to elucidate their dynamics. 

Reaction-based models are formalized as sets of reactions that describe the given system in terms of mechanistic interactions between the species of interest. This is, biochemical networks are a set of chemical species that can be converted into each other through chemical reactions. The focus of biochemical network models is usually on the levels of the chemical species and this usually requires explicit mathematical expressions for the velocity at which the reactions proceed. Biological systems can be simulated in different ways using different algorithms depending on the assumptions made about the underlying kinetics. Once the kinetics have been specified, these systems can be used directly to construct full dynamic simulations of the system behaviour on a computer.

### Computational models of CaMKII and NMDARs

## Reproducibility, Ethics and Data Hazards

Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell, BioNetGen and CellBlender, I model molecular interactions. Throughout this PhD project, I identify key factors influencing the efficacy and dynamics of these interactions. These findings contribute to understanding synaptic plasticity mechanisms crucial for memory formation. The biological question that started this PhD was "_How do CaMKII and NMDARs in the postsynaptic neuron interact and enable the processes of learning and memory?_".

As my research progressed, I became increasingly aware of the importance of addressing ethical issues in science, including the biases that persist if not properly examined. Likewise, there is a significant waste of research time and resources that results from conducting experiments that cannot be reliably reproduced or replicated. We might like to think that scientific research is objective, and simply measuring reality. The reality, however, is that many decisions will be taken when doing research, and these decisions will impact the results of that research. If decisions are not well documented, the validity of the research can become more opaque. Similarly, an important issue in scientific work that makes it difficult for other people to build on is that materials or details of analyses are not freely shared, which is why open science is important when overcoming these issues. This awareness has led me to emphasize these issues throughout my work. A key strength of this PhD is its demonstration of how a computational biology project can be reproducible and integrate ethics from the start, as reflected in the Data Hazards aspect of the project.

## Project objectives

I employ computer simulations to answer the project’s biological question; it is important to note that while the focus of this project is mainly computational, this is part of a synergistic work with colleagues performing wet-lab experiments. Experiments provide data to inform simulation parameters, which in turn can guide the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, in a self-enhancing loop. In short, the main objectives of the project are to:

- Build a computational model of the regulation and interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs in a dendritic spine.
- Make biological predictions from the model which can then be tested experimentally in-vivo or in-vitro.
- Use the model to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics of early LTP and understand the role of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions.
- Develop new workflows to model biological interactions in 3D space, using software like MCell (Monte Carlo Cell) and CellBlender (Stiles et al., 1996; Kerr et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2018; Husar et al., 2022), BioNetGen (Harris et al., 2016) and BioDynaMo (Breitwieser et al., 2022).

## The big picture: What research exists already and where does this PhD stand?

Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [REFERENCES]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex [REFERENCES], but not on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex therefore making this research novel in its field. The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [Pharris, Ordyan, Bartol] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell. Pharris look at this, Ordyan looks at this, Bartol looks at this. This is what I look at.

There is a plethora of computational models with a focus around CaMKII that use software such as NEURON [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], Smoldyn [@khan2011Sequestration], Cellular Dynamic Simulator [@byrne2011Impacts; @byrne2010Cellular], and more [REFERENCES]. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule [Pharris, CDS paper]. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

Incorporating spatial, temporal, and multimeric aspects is crucial because these dimensions fundamentally shape the behavior of molecular complexes like like the CaMKII/NMDAR interaction. Spatial dynamics can reveal how the molecules interact within different cellular regions, in fact CaMKII phosphorylation levels, as well as its functions have been shown to differ depending on its subcellular localization [@davies2007ACaMKII]. Temporal dynamics are important to understand how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions evolve over time; which is a matter yet to be fully understood, such as: how long does the CaMKII/NMDAR complex last during and/or after LTP?. 

_Needs to go somewhere else not sure where:_ More recently, research is shifting from the long-standing idea that CaMKII behaves like a bistable switch to a new understanding involving a process known as "kinetic proofreading" that enhances the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling. Bartol et al., 2024 propose that for LTP to occur, the autophosphorylation of CaMKII subunits does not need to reach the high, irreversible steady-state associated with the bistable switch theory. Instead, they propose that the integration of signals at the synapse must lead to a temporary surge in autophosphorylation that is sufficient to initiate one or more downstream processes, which are essentially irreversible, ultimately resulting in synaptic potentiation. This proposed mechanism aligns well with the hypothesis that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex at the PSD plays a critical role in stabilizing CaMKII in its autophosphorylated state, thereby facilitating synaptic potentiation.
