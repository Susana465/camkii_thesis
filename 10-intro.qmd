# Introduction:

this is what most people will read, so keep it more simple and go into very specific descriptions later in the background where i lay out the pillars for where this phd stands on.

Introduction to the introduction: a short version (of only a few paragraphs) of the thesisâ€™ aims, research questions, contribution, objectives and findings.

1. Establish your research territory (by situating your research in a broader context)
One of the first things the introduction should do is to provide general statements that outline the importance of the topic and provide enough background information so that the reader can understand the context in which your research sits (although being careful not to enter into an in-depth review of the literature. More on this below). In doing so, you will need to reference existing studies.

There have been many studies that focus on CaM and CaMKII dynamics. Studies using modelling like we do. For over a decade now, and these dynamics are more well documented. Likewise, there's quite a lot of information out there on Calcium and calmodulin binding. As we discuss in the coming chapters, however, there is still no consensus on certain things. parameters are hard to get to begin with.

State the overarching topic and aims of the thesis in more detail
Provide a brief review of the literature related to the topic (this will be very brief if you have a separate literature review chapter)
Define the terms and scope of the topic
Critically evaluate the current state of the literature on that topic and identify your gap
Outline why the research is important and the contribution that it makes
Outline your epistemological and ontological position
Clearly outline the research questions and problem(s) you seek to address
State the hypotheses (if you are using any)
Detail the most important concepts and variables
Briefly describe your methodology
Discuss the main findings
Discuss the layout of the thesis
