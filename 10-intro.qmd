# Lay Summary:

This PhD project weaves together multiple threads, including biological questions as well as ethical ones. The foundational thread of this PhD is rooted in a biological question: looking at specific molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory in animals. Interwoven with this, is the exploration of how these mechanisms can be studied through computer models in a manner that is both reproducible and ethically responsible.

Understanding how learning and memory work at the molecular level can reveal important insights into brain function and potentially help develop treatments for memory-related illnesses. While research in this field often focuses on finding cures, I argue that the true value of this PhD lies not in directly discovering a new mechanism or potential drug, but in providing a project that shows how to create a PhD that upholds research integrity, ensures reproducibility, minimizes waste, and thoughtfully considers broader ethical implications.

Firstly, to address the biological aspect of this PhD, I begin by explaining why I focus on memory, learning, and the specific molecules involved in these processes. During learning and memory, neural circuits are altered in our brains. These circuits are composed of neurons (nerve cells) that communicate with one another through special junctions called synapses. These synapses contain a pre-synaptic neuron that sends a signal to the post-synaptic neuron. When the travelling signal reaches the end of the presynaptic neuron, it triggers the release of chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters. These chemical messengers cross the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, which triggers a cascade of molecular events. This can lead to changes in the strength of synaptic connections. A persistent strengthening of synaptic connections is known as Long Term Potentiation (LTP), which is considered a potential mechanism for explaining learning and memory at the cellular level, where neuronal connections become stronger with repeated activation.

In this cascade of events, I investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of two molecules in the postsynaptic neuron: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII and NMDARs are key components of a complex network within neurons that work together to strengthen neuronal connections. 

CaMKII is a complex molecule formed of 12 subunits (dodecamer). Its unique structure allows it to stay active for a long time after an initial signal has passed. CaMKIIS capacity to remain active is crucial for strengthening synapses during LTP. Importantly, recent research has shown that the direct interaction between CaMKII and NDMARs might be a minimal requirement for LTP. This means that by focusing on these essential molecular interactions —those between CaMKII and NMDARs— we may be able to isolate some of the essential steps that are eventually leading to memory formation without the added complexity of larger molecular networks.

Moreover, growing evidence suggests that the interaction between NMDARs and CaMKII plays a crucial role at the molecular level in processes related to memory and learning. For example, studies (ab)using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment. Additionally, changes in the function of these molecules have been implicated in a range of diseases and conditions, including age-related cognitive decline in human and non-human animals and neurodegenerative diseases. Likewise, these changes have also been shown to be implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, addiction, autism spectrum, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.

I use computational models to simulate molecular interactions and investigate these molecular processes. A key innovation in my research is the development of a reproducible computer model that, to the best of my knowledge, is the first to simulate CaMKII as a dodecamer directly interacting with NMDARs in both time and space within a realistic neuronal environment. While previous studies have modelled CaMKII as a dodecamer in a 3D space and over time, they did not explore its direct interactions with NMDARs. This research is valuable because it allows us to make predictions about how CaMKII may interact with NMDARs as essential components for memory mechanisms. 

Given the complexity and multiscale nature of the biological system studied, computational models like the one used in this project play a crucial role in integrating experimental data and theoretical hypotheses. In general, models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions. Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

A major emphasis in this PhD is placed on ensuring these models and the techniques used adhere to the principles of reproducibility and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. This commitment to open, transparent, and ethically responsible research is one of the core strengths of the project. While the PhD centres on creating a biological model of NMDARs and CaMKII, its true value lies in how the model is developed, documented, and made accessible, allowing others to easily build upon it. The model presented in this thesis is reproducible and serves as a case study for how biological models can be developed with careful attention to both scientific integrity and ethical considerations.

Therefore, this project goes beyond simply creating a model to understand a biological mechanism; this project addresses the pressing issue of how models can be shared and refined in an open, accountable manner, ensuring the research community can rely on them. Ignoring these principles often leads to wasted resources, lost progress, and flawed conclusions—something we cannot afford, especially when working on models that may have real-world implications for areas like memory and neurobiology.

To explore the ethical implications of this PhD, I use the Data Hazards framework, to which I have contributed in its development. This framework highlights the potential risks associated with research, including topics such as environmental impacts, biases, and misuse of the work at hand. By using Data Hazards, I identify and address key ethical concerns, assigning hazard-like labels (similar to chemical warning labels) to specific risks such as "danger of misuse" or "high environmental impact". This proactive approach allows me to implement and suggest precautions to mitigate potential risks throughout the research process —from design to execution.
