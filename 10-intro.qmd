# Introduction:

This PhD project investigates the temporal and spatial dynamics of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) interactions within the dendritic postsynaptic density. Changes in the function of these synaptic proteins have been implicated in a range of diseases and conditions, including age-related cognitive decline (see, for instance, (Li, Marcu, et al., 2020)) and neurodegenerative diseases (REFERENCES: Reviewed in (Foster, 2007; Tong et al., 2018)). Moreover, these changes have been shown to be implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, addiction, autism spectrum condition, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (reviewed in (Robison, 2014)).

Additionally, alterations in synaptic strength, like Long-Term Depression (LTD) and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), involve diverse chemical pathways that have been used to explore the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008Dissecting]. In particular, studying learning and memory at the molecular level reveals that NMDAR and CaMKII, interacting with other proteins within dendritic spines, play a role in influencing dendritic spines' shape and function [@fink2002Molecular]. Studies using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment [@moyano2004NMDA, @zhou2007Interactions, @halt2012CaMKII]. 

Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell, BioNetGen and CellBlender, I model molecular interactions. Throughout this PhD project, I identify key factors influencing the efficacy and dynamics of these interactions. These findings contribute to understanding synaptic plasticity mechanisms crucial for memory formation. The biological question that started this PhD was "_How do CaMKII and NMDARs in the postsynaptic neuron interact and enable the processes of learning and memory?_".

As my research progressed, I became increasingly aware of the importance of addressing ethical issues in science, including the biases that persist if not properly examined. Likewise, there is a significant waste of research time and resources that results from conducting experiments that cannot be reliably reproduced or replicated. We might like to think that scientific research is objective, and simply measuring reality. The reality, however, is that many decisions will be taken when doing research, and these decisions will impact the results of that research. If decisions are not well documented, the validity of the research can become more opaque. Similarly, an important issue in scientific work that makes it difficult for other people to build on is that materials or details of analyses are not freely shared, which is why open science is important when overcoming these issues. This awareness has led me to emphasize these issues throughout my work. A key strength of this PhD is its demonstration of how a computational biology project can be reproducible and integrate ethics from the start, as reflected in the Data Hazards aspect of the project.

## Project objectives

I employ computer simulations to answer the projectâ€™s biological question; it is important to note that while the focus of this project is mainly computational, this is part of a synergistic work with colleagues performing wet-lab experiments. Experiments provide data to inform simulation parameters, which in turn can guide the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, in a self-enhancing loop. In short, the main objectives of the project are to:

- Build a computational model of the regulation and interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs in a dendritic spine.
- Make biological predictions from the model which can then be tested experimentally in-vivo or in-vitro.
- Use the model to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics of early LTP and understand the role of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions.
- Develop new workflows to model biological interactions in 3D space, using software like MCell (Monte Carlo Cell) and CellBlender (Stiles et al., 1996; Kerr et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2018; Husar et al., 2022), BioNetGen (Harris et al., 2016) and BioDynaMo (Breitwieser et al., 2022).

## CaMKII/NMDAR interactions to understand LTP and memory:

The cellular changes that underline different forms of memory are thought to involve changes in the strength of neuronal connections, as proposed by @ramonycajal1909HistologieSystemeNerveux more than a century ago. The notion that synaptic strength changes during learning and memory was refined into a concrete model by @hebb1949OrganizationBehaviorNeuropsychological. Hebb proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time, the synapses between them are strengthened. This hypothesis inspired many researchers, and the first mechanism supporting it, long-term potentiation, was discovered in the early 1970s. The discovery of LTP showed that short, high frequency stimulation (tetanus) of hippocampal excitatory synapses produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the strength of these synapses that could persist for many days. LTP is often divided into three phases: induction, expression, and maintenance. To this day, LTP has been described at synapses throughout the brain and remains one of the most attractive cellular models for learning and memory. There are multiple forms of LTP. The variables include the type of synapse, the stimulation parameters, the time analysed after LTP induction, and the developmental age. 

It is LTP that depends on NMDAR activation where much research has been done [@malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @nicoll2017BriefHistoryLongTerm], as it is a well-characterized form of LTP that directly links synaptic activity to molecular signaling pathways crucial for learning and memory. In this project we focus on this type of LTP. During NMDA-receptor dependent LTP, glutamate is released from the presynaptic terminal, this glutamate then activates a subtype of glutamate receptor known as the AMPA receptor. NMDA receptors are found nearby these AMPA receptors, but are not activated by low levels of glutamate release because the ion channel of an NMDA receptor is blocked by a magnesium ion. If frequent action potentials cause greater stimulation of AMPA receptors, however, this will cause the postsynaptic neuron to depolarize, which eventually causes the voltage-dependent magnesium blockage of the NMDA receptor to be removed, allowing calcium ions to flow in through the NMDA receptor.

The influx of calcium causes a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations in the postsynaptic density (PSD). The rise of intracellular calcium then triggers a cascade of events, where Ca2+ can bind to calmodulin (CaM), and CaM can then aid in CaMKII activation. The activation of CaMKII can allow for various mechanisms of LTP to proceed. CaMKII activity has been shown to be crucial for this form of LTP induction and maintenance, hence, understanding its mechanisms may offer insights into the molecular processes supporting memory stability. As a central signaling protein, CaMKII regulates various cellular functions, including synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, cell growth and division, gene transcription, and ion channel modulation. 

An important asset of CaMKII is that it can remain in an active state for prolonged periods of time, even after the initial calcium stimulus is gone. CaMKII can bind to NMDA receptors in the membrane of the cell to enhance its efficiency for receiving new stimuli. CaMKII can also be found bound to the actin filaments which form the cytoskeleton of the neuron. Active CaMKII can unbind from these actin filaments which leads to an expansion in shape of the dendritic spine. This increase in sensitivity to stimuli as well as the expansion of dendritic spines are suggested to allow for synaptic strengthening that happens in LTP.

Importantly, CaMKII and NMDAR binding has been shown to maintain LTP [REFERENCE]; however, the exact mechanisms behind this remain unclear. We don't know how long the CaMKII/NMDAR complex lasts after LTP induction (REFERENCES NEED TO LOOK THIS UP GOOD TO TEST) and more work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. What is more, the precise mechanism of CaMKII and NMDAR interaction to form a complex remains unclear. A longstanding model suggested CaMKII has two distinct sites that bind to the NMDAR C-terminal [REFERENCES]. However, recent crystal structure studies challenge this, showing that CaMKII substrates and activators bind to a single continuous site across the kinase domain [REFERENCE]. The CaMKII/NMDAR complex enables activity-dependent CaMKII incorporation into postsynaptic sites, potentially acting as a structural seed to recruit postsynaptic density proteins, contributing to synapse restructuring and plasticity. 

The specific mechanisms through which the CaMKII/NMDAR complex sustains LTP and facilitates synaptic restructuring remain poorly understood, highlighting the need for further research into their interactions. Understanding these dynamics is important as it may provide insights into the biochemical processes that stabilize memories and contribute to our overall understanding of LTP and memory formation.

## Why use computational modelling to study biological systems?

Experimental studies are increasingly complemented by computational models to aid in characterizing the spatiotemporal regulation of proteins of interest [REFERENCES]. Given the complexity and multiscale nature of biological systems, computational models play a crucial role in integrating experimental data, facilitating theoretical hypotheses, and exploring "what if" scenarios. Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions.

Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

## The big picture: What research exists already and where does this PhD stand?

Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [REFERENCES]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex [REFERENCES], but not on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex therefore making this research novel in its field. The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [Pharris, Ordyan, Bartol] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell. Pharris look at this, Ordyan looks at this, Bartol looks at this. This is what I look at.

There is a plethora of computational models with a focus around CaMKII that use software such as NEURON [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], Smoldyn [@khan2011Sequestration], Cellular Dynamic Simulator [@byrne2011Impacts; @byrne2010Cellular], and more [REFERENCES]. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule [Pharris, CDS paper]. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

More recently, research is shifting from the long-standing idea that CaMKII behaves like a bistable switch to a new understanding involving a process known as "kinetic proofreading" that enhances the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling. Bartol et al., 2024 propose that for LTP to occur, the autophosphorylation of CaMKII subunits does not need to reach the high, irreversible steady-state associated with the bistable switch theory. Instead, they propose that the integration of signals at the synapse must lead to a temporary surge in autophosphorylation that is sufficient to initiate one or more downstream processes, which are essentially irreversible, ultimately resulting in synaptic potentiation. This proposed mechanism aligns well with the hypothesis that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex at the PSD plays a critical role in stabilizing CaMKII in its autophosphorylated state, thereby facilitating synaptic potentiation.

## Thesis Layout
To be completed.

As I was thinking about how to layout this thesis, an idea came to me: what if my PhD is like a house, or a hut or something like that? That would help me keep a good picture of the function of each chapter laid out here. So here are some thoughts on how this thesis is laid out; kinda like all thesis are laid out, and like all houses are built, there's common features but each thesis/house comes with the flavour of the person that lives in it.

If we think of the PhD as a house, then, the pillars or support beams are where I lay out the existing research, the theoretical background, and the context. These are solid and well-researched to support the entire structure, much like how background chapters provide the knowledge necessary to frame ones work. The main room or entrance is the introduction, it welcomes the guests (readers) and sets the stage. The introduction tells you what you are about to explore: the core ideas, the goals, and what to expect.
