# Introduction:

## What is this PhD about? A quick overview:

This PhD project weaves together multiple threads. The foundational thread of this PhD is rooted in a biological question: understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying memory in animals. To investigate these molecular processes, the project uses computational models to simulate molecular interactions. Experimental studies are increasingly complemented by computational models to aid in characterizing the spatiotemporal regulation of proteins of interest [REFERENCES]. Given the complexity and multiscale nature of biological systems, computational models play a crucial role in integrating experimental data and theoretical hypotheses. Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions.

Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

A major emphasis is placed on ensuring these models and the techniques used adhere to the principles of reproducibility and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. Another critical thread of this research involves examining the ethical implications of the work, particularly in identifying potential biases and dangers that may be carried on. In order to think about ethical implications of this work, I use the Data Hazards framework. This framework assigns hazard-like labels—similar to chemical warning labels—to highlight risks such as “danger of misuse” or “high environmental impact.” By doing so, I identify and address relevant ethical risks, implementing or suggesting appropriate safety precautions to mitigate them throughout the research process, from inception to conclusion. 

To provide a more comprehensive overview of these different threads, this introduction chapter will first explore the biological background relevant to the project, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms proposed to underlie memory and learning in animals. Following this, I will introduce how and why I choose to simulate these molecular mechanisms using computational models. Finally, I will conclude the introduction by briefly discussing how the concept of Data Hazards ties together and encapsulates the entire PhD. 

## Biological Background
### Long Term Potentiaion underlies learning and memory

The cellular changes that underline different forms of memory are thought to involve changes in the strength of neuronal connections. Over a century ago, @ramonycajal1909HistologieSystemeNerveux proposed that the nervous system is composed of microscopic, independent cells —neurons— that form intricate networks of connections. The notion that synaptic strength changes during learning and memory was refined into a concrete model by @hebb1949OrganizationBehaviorNeuropsychological. Hebb proposed that if two neurons are active at the same time, the synapses between them are strengthened. The first mechanism supporting synaptic strengthening, long-term potentiation (LTP), was then discovered in the late 1960s using rabbits' hippocampus _in vitro_. This discovery of LTP showed that short, high frequency stimulation (tetanus) of hippocampal excitatory synapses produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the strength of these synapses that could persist for many days [LOMO Gardner-Medwin REFERENCE]. 

In 1986, Morris et al. provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories _in vivo_ using rats. These rats were used to test the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which the rats swam in a pool of murky water until they located a platform hidden beneath the surface. During this exercise, the rats had no other choice but to learn the location of the hidden platform through salient cues placed at specific positions around the maze's circumference. After the rats had memorised where the cues and platforms were, one group was subjected to having their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while another group to whom nothing was done to, served as the control. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool. However, the rats that had been subjected to APV treatment had significantly impaired memory. Moreover, when both groups were killed and slices of their hippocampal slices were analyzed, LTP was readily induced in the control group, while it could not be induced in the brains of the rats subjected to APV treatment. This experiment using rats provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory. In the years since, there have been many more experiments conducted on rodents, often using fear conditioning or subjecting them to brain injuries, that provide further evidence of LTP's role in different types of memory and learning [REFERENCES].

Since its discovery, different forms of LTP have been observed throughout different regions in the brain, in human and non-human animals [REFERENCES]. What is more, the different forms of LTP further depend on a number of factors such as developmental stage, pre- or post-synaptic stimulation as well as stimulation protocols. Two major types of LTP have been described as being either NMDA receptor-dependent or NMDA receptor-independent [REFERENCES @kumar2011LongTerm (Grover and Teyler, 1992; Cavus and Teyler, 1996)]. For example, LTP induced at the CA3–CA1 hippocampal synapses employing high-frequency stimulation has been shown to be dependent on the NMDA receptor (Collingridge et al., 1983; Harris et al., 1984; Morris et al., 1986), whereas at the same synapses, an NMDA-independent form of LTP can be induced by using a 200-Hz stimulation protocol [@grover1990Two; @grover1998Evidence], among other stimulation protocols [@aou2003Orexinhypocretin1; @rebola2008Adenosine; @erondu1985RegionalDistributionType; @bortolotto1999Roles; @zi1993Induction; @bortolotto1993Characterisation]. Different forms of LTP have also been observed at CA1 hippocampal synapses versus mossy fibre synapses at CA3 pyramidal cells. LTP at CA1 synapses, which can be representative of LTP at excitatory synapses, is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and primarily involves a modification of the postsynaptic neuron. Mossy fibre LTP, on the other hand, is independent of NMDA receptors and has been shown to be entirely expressed presynaptically (Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). This project will focus on studying the NMDA receptor-dependent form of LTP at synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To avoid ambiguities, this is the type of LTP discussed unless otherwise stated. 

LTP is usually divided into two main phases: early (E-LTP) and late LTP (L-LTP), although an initial/short sterm potentiation and an intermidiate phase of LTP have also been suggested [REFERENCES]. E-LTP occurs shortly after high-frequency stimulation of a synapse, and is typically characterized by a rapid increase in synaptic strength that lasts for a few minutes to hours [REFERENCES]. It relies primarily on the activation of NMDA receptors and the influx of calcium ions. L-LTP, on the other hand, is the prolonged phase of synaptic enhancement that can last for days or even weeks. L-LTP is dependent on new protein synthesis and gene expression. This phase is critical for the consolidation of memory and is associated with structural changes in the synapse, including the growth of dendritic spines and the synthesis of new receptors. Within these phases, LTP is also often divided into three main events: induction, expression, and maintenance [REFERENCES]. Induction refers to the transient events that initiate the formation of LTP. Maintenance refers to "the persisting biochemical signal that lasts in the cell" [@sweatt2010Chaptera]. This lasting biochemical signal influences an effector, such as a glutamate receptor or the presynaptic release machinery, leading to the expression of LTP.

These three events are not rigidly defined as sequential phases of LTP; rather, they serve as distinct categories to help us talk about the different stages of LTP. Induction, expression, and maintenance can apply to both E-LTP and L-LTP; with E-LTP and L-LTP phases being _induced_ and _expressed_ in diverse ways (for example, either through protein synthesis or not) and _maintained_ for differing durations (for seconds, hours or longer). Additionally, E-LTP and L-LTP are not mutually exclusive. In fact, depending on the specific LTP induction protocol applied, E-LTP can happen concurrently with the development of L-LTP, with one gradually replacing the other over time [@roberson1996Biochemists]. This PhD research focuses on the role of specific molecular interactions that happen during E-LTP induction and maintenance, as discussed in the following sections.

### LTP as an attractive model to explain memory at the cellular and molecular level

To this day, LTP remains an attractive model to explain memory at the cellular and molecular level due to some of its properties. These properties include the principles of associativity, cooperativity, input-specificity, and persistence. The associativity principle indicates that a weak tetanic stimulation that activates only a few fibers does not induce LTP. However, simultaneous strong stimulation of a neighboring pathway can induce LTP in both synaptic pathways (Levy and Steward, 1979). Cooperativity can be observed when a weak stimulation is paired with a strong postsynaptic depolarization. In this case, LTP is induced only if the postsynaptic cell is depolarized within approximately 100ms of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic cell. Input-specificity stipulates that LTP occurs only in the synaptic pathway that received the tetanic stimulation, whilst inactive synapses that contact the same neuron will not share synaptic enhancement (Andersen et al., 1977; Lynch et al., 1977). Together, these characteristics set conditional requirements that are likely to allow selective strengthening of specific synaptic connections thought to be involved in memory storage. In regards to persistence, LTP has been shown to last for several hours in _in vitro_ slice preparations and for many months in freely moving animals (in vivo; Abraham, 2003), suggesting a capacity for sustained physiological changes that align with memory formation. 

#### Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in LTP

There are multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to induction, expression, and maintenance of LTP. E-LTP is induced when the intracellular calcium concentration in the postsynaptic cell rises above a critical threshold. The influx of Ca²⁺ into the cell is facilitated by NMDA receptors, which are ionotropic, non-selective cationic glutamate receptors essential for the rapid regulation of synaptic plasticity. The activation of the NMDA receptor is regulated by a voltage-dependent magnesium (Mg++) block within the channel's pore. For the Mg++ ion to be expelled from the pore, membrane depolarization is required. Once this occurs, calcium ions can pass through it. As a result, these receptors act as molecular coincidence detectors, allowing ion flux only when these conditions are met. This is a critical aspect of NMDA receptor regulation, enabling the NMDA receptor to play a unique role in molecular-level information processing.

Tetanic stimulation of presynaptic fibers leads to the release of neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate, onto the membrane of the postsynaptic cell. Glutamate binding to postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors triggers an influx of positively charged sodium ions into the postsynaptic cell, which leads to cell depolarization. The magnitude of depolarization determines the amount of Ca2+ entry into the postsynaptic cell. If the degree of depolarization is sufficient to remove the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor, then the channel will allow influx of Ca2+ into the cell. If the depolarization is strong enough to remove the voltage dependent Mg²⁺ block from NMDA receptors, the channel allows influx of Ca²⁺ ions into the cell. The influx of calcium leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of dendritic spines, which are specialized protrusions on neurons that serve as the primary sites for excitatory synaptic transmission. This high and rapid rise in intracellular calcium then triggers a cascade of events, including activation of several kinases, such as calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). 

CaMKII is a critical synaptic protein that constitutes up to 2% of total brain protein. This kinase is a large holoenzyme consisting of 12 subunits, and each of the subunits importantly have a catalytic domain and an autophosphorylation domain [FIGURE]. A key characteristic of CaMKII regulation, crucial for the maintenance of E-LTP, is its ability to autophosphorylate at T286. This enables CaMKII to become a calcium–calmodulin-independent "autonomous" kinase, allowing its activity to persist even after the initial calcium stimulus has passed. _T286-phosphorylation has been described as a form of molecular memory, and is indeed required for normal learning and memory, as well as for two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and depression4,5. Another form of molecular memory by CaMKII is formed through the regulated binding to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B, which can also generate autonomous activity6. This CaMKII/GluN2B binding is specifically required for maintenance of synaptic strength7 and for normal long-term potentiation but not long-term depression8._ @myers2017CaMKII

As a central signaling protein, CaMKII regulates various cellular functions, including synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, cell growth and division, gene transcription, and ion channel modulation. 

what do i wanna say here?
Research on CaMKII strongly supports the notion that this enzyme is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of LTP, backed by substantial evidence.

A rise in calcium lasting less than 2-3 seconds appears to be sufficient to induce LTP, but the magnitude and microdomain location of this signal remain to be reached within consesus for. 

[INSER FIGURE OF DENDRITE AND PSD WITH NMDAR AND AMPARs]

Notably, CaMKII has been extensively proposed to be a key mediator of E-LTP [REFERENCES]. 

During NMDA-receptor dependent LTP, glutamate is released from the presynaptic terminal, which then activates a subtype of glutamate receptor known as the AMPA receptor. NMDA receptors are found nearby these AMPA receptors, but are not activated by low levels of glutamate due to a magnesium ion blocking the pore. If frequent action potentials cause greater stimulation of AMPA receptors, however, this will cause the postsynaptic neuron to depolarize, removing the voltage-dependent magnesium blockage of the NMDA receptor, allowing calcium ions to flow in through the NMDA receptor.

The process of linking cellular mechanisms underlying LTP to learning and memory is often challenging and not always linear. We may feel inclined to infer that one event is a direct consequence of another; however, the mechanisms governing memory formation are intricate and do not always adhere to straightforward cause-and-effect pathways. For instance, while the work of @morris1986Selective  selectively linking LTP to NMDARs was pivotal in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying memory, it was not without its limitations. One significant limitation was the later realization that NMDA receptors play two roles. While their most widely recognized role involves LTP, NMDARs also play a role in the regulation of synaptic transmission on a moment-to-moment basis, independent of LTP (due to the incomplete Mg²⁺ block at resting potentials). This raised an alternative explanation for Morris' experiments: APV was maybe disrupting hippocampal function more broadly. This caveat was addressed by Giese et al., 1998, who genetically modified a knockin mouse containing the point mutant T286A of CaMKII. This mutation prevents autophosphorylation and blocks CaM-independent persistent activity of the enzyme. In the CaMKII mutant mice subjected to this experiment, NMDA receptor function remained intact, but LTP was absent and learning and memory were strongly impaired. This provided evidence that induced coginitive deficits in rodents were most likely caused by LTP disruption, rather than by general NMDAR dysfunction, as normal NMDA receptor function was maintained throughout the experiment. Taken together, these studies provide compelling evidence for LTP's role in learning and memory.

Numerous other kinases and proteins are involved in this complex and intricate mechanism, which has made it challenging to identify all the participating components over the past century. Key players include protein kinase C (PKC), neurogranin, and DAPK1, among others; however, these proteins are beyond the scope of the present project AND discussion of possible interactions 

and protein kinase C (PKC) have been extensively shown to be involved and likely mediate induction of E-LTP [REFERENCES]. In response to a rise in calcium, both kinases can be phosphorylated in an autonomous manner and remain active without the continued presence of calcium. 

where Ca2+ can bind to calmodulin (CaM), and CaM can then aid in CaMKII activation. The activation of CaMKII can allow for various mechanisms of LTP to proceed. CaMKII activity has been shown to be crucial for this form of LTP induction and maintenance, hence, understanding its mechanisms may offer insights into the molecular processes supporting memory stability. As a central signaling protein, CaMKII regulates various cellular functions, including synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, cell growth and division, gene transcription, and ion channel modulation.

Early LTP (E-LTP) represents the very first stage of LTP and is a continual form of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity. 

While induction entails the transient activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) is characterized by their persistent activation. It lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, and is independent of protein synthesis

Early LTP represents the foremost stage of LTP and is a continual form of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, and lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. L-LTP, induced by delivery of multiple tetanic stimuli, lasts 5–6 h and requires protein synthesis and gene expression E-LTP, which is evoked by fewer tetanic stimuli and lasts 2–3 h


To this day, LTP has been described at synapses throughout the brain and remains one of the most attractive cellular models for learning and memory.

As memories are believed to be encoded through changes in synaptic strength, LTP is broadly regarded as one of the primary cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory [REFERENCE].

 depending on the region it is expressed in, the type of synapse, the developmental age, or the pre- and postsynaptic activity required to induce it.

Additionally, LTP has certain properties that make it a strong model to explain memory at the cellular and molecular level. One of these properties is that LTP is input-specific, meaning it occurs only in the pathway that received the tetanic stimulation. This characteristic is likely crucial for the capacity to store information, as it allows for selective strengthening of specific synaptic connections. The induction of LTP is also tightly regulated, occurring only in response to sufficiently strong stimuli. LTP is also associative in the sense that it can occur following the contribution of two distinct sets of inputs. For example, weak stimulation of one pathway, which does not induce plasticity, paired with strong stimulation of another pathway, which induces LTP, can induce potentiation of both pathways

LTP is often divided into three phases: induction, expression, and maintenance. To this day, LTP has been described at synapses throughout the brain and remains one of the most attractive cellular models for learning and memory. 

LTP is considered a key determinant for memory at the molecular level due to the various biochemical and cellular processes that occur at the synaptic level, leading to enduring changes in synaptic strength.

occurs during learning and can last for long periods, making it a probable mechanism for memory storage. Additionally, 


 _The variables include the type of synapse, the stimulation parameters, the time analysed after LTP induction, and the developmental age._

It is LTP that depends on NMDAR activation where much research has been done [@malenka2004LTPLTDEmbarrassment; @nicoll2017BriefHistoryLongTerm], as it is a well-characterized form of LTP that directly links synaptic activity to molecular signaling pathways crucial for learning and memory. In this project we focus on this type of LTP. During NMDA-receptor dependent LTP, glutamate is released from the presynaptic terminal, which then activates a subtype of glutamate receptor known as the AMPA receptor. NMDA receptors are found nearby these AMPA receptors, but are not activated by low levels of glutamate release because the ion channel of an NMDA receptor is blocked by a magnesium ion. If frequent action potentials cause greater stimulation of AMPA receptors, however, this will cause the postsynaptic neuron to depolarize, which eventually causes the voltage-dependent magnesium blockage of the NMDA receptor to be removed, allowing calcium ions to flow in through the NMDA receptor.

The influx of calcium causes a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations in the postsynaptic density (PSD). The rise of intracellular calcium then triggers a cascade of events, where Ca2+ can bind to calmodulin (CaM), and CaM can then aid in CaMKII activation. The activation of CaMKII can allow for various mechanisms of LTP to proceed. CaMKII activity has been shown to be crucial for this form of LTP induction and maintenance, hence, understanding its mechanisms may offer insights into the molecular processes supporting memory stability. As a central signaling protein, CaMKII regulates various cellular functions, including synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, cell growth and division, gene transcription, and ion channel modulation. 

An important asset of CaMKII is that it can remain in an active state for prolonged periods of time, even after the initial calcium stimulus is gone. CaMKII can bind to NMDA receptors in the membrane of the cell to enhance its efficiency for receiving new stimuli. CaMKII can also be found bound to the actin filaments which form the cytoskeleton of the neuron. Active CaMKII can unbind from these actin filaments which leads to an expansion in shape of the dendritic spine. This increase in sensitivity to stimuli as well as the expansion of dendritic spines are suggested to allow for synaptic strengthening that happens in LTP.

Importantly, CaMKII and NMDAR binding has been shown to maintain LTP [REFERENCE]; however, the exact mechanisms behind this remain unclear. We don't know how long the CaMKII/NMDAR complex lasts after LTP induction (REFERENCES NEED TO LOOK THIS UP GOOD TO TEST) and more work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. What is more, the precise mechanism of CaMKII and NMDAR interaction to form a complex remains unclear. A longstanding model suggested CaMKII has two distinct sites that bind to the NMDAR C-terminal [REFERENCES]. However, recent crystal structure studies challenge this, showing that CaMKII substrates and activators bind to a single continuous site across the kinase domain [REFERENCE]. The CaMKII/NMDAR complex enables activity-dependent CaMKII incorporation into postsynaptic sites, potentially acting as a structural seed to recruit postsynaptic density proteins, contributing to synapse restructuring and plasticity. 

The specific mechanisms through which the CaMKII/NMDAR complex sustains LTP and facilitates synaptic restructuring remain poorly understood, highlighting the need for further research into their interactions. Understanding these dynamics is important as it may provide insights into the biochemical processes that stabilize memories and contribute to our overall understanding of LTP and memory formation.
### Why use computational modelling to study biological systems

### Reproducibility, Ethics and Data Hazards

This PhD project investigates the temporal and spatial dynamics of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) interactions within the dendritic postsynaptic density. Changes in the function of these synaptic proteins have been implicated in a range of diseases and conditions, including age-related cognitive decline (see, for instance, (Li, Marcu, et al., 2020)) and neurodegenerative diseases (REFERENCES: Reviewed in (Foster, 2007; Tong et al., 2018)). Moreover, these changes have been shown to be implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, addiction, autism spectrum condition, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (reviewed in (Robison, 2014)).

Additionally, alterations in synaptic strength, like Long-Term Depression (LTD) and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), involve diverse chemical pathways that have been used to explore the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008Dissecting]. In particular, studying learning and memory at the molecular level reveals that NMDAR and CaMKII, interacting with other proteins within dendritic spines, play a role in influencing dendritic spines' shape and function [@fink2002Molecular]. Studies using rodents have shown that impairing these molecules interacting, or abolishing their functions leads to memory impairment [@moyano2004NMDA, @zhou2007Interactions, @halt2012CaMKII]. 

Using Monte Carlo algorithm simulations with MCell, BioNetGen and CellBlender, I model molecular interactions. Throughout this PhD project, I identify key factors influencing the efficacy and dynamics of these interactions. These findings contribute to understanding synaptic plasticity mechanisms crucial for memory formation. The biological question that started this PhD was "_How do CaMKII and NMDARs in the postsynaptic neuron interact and enable the processes of learning and memory?_".

As my research progressed, I became increasingly aware of the importance of addressing ethical issues in science, including the biases that persist if not properly examined. Likewise, there is a significant waste of research time and resources that results from conducting experiments that cannot be reliably reproduced or replicated. We might like to think that scientific research is objective, and simply measuring reality. The reality, however, is that many decisions will be taken when doing research, and these decisions will impact the results of that research. If decisions are not well documented, the validity of the research can become more opaque. Similarly, an important issue in scientific work that makes it difficult for other people to build on is that materials or details of analyses are not freely shared, which is why open science is important when overcoming these issues. This awareness has led me to emphasize these issues throughout my work. A key strength of this PhD is its demonstration of how a computational biology project can be reproducible and integrate ethics from the start, as reflected in the Data Hazards aspect of the project.

## Project objectives

I employ computer simulations to answer the project’s biological question; it is important to note that while the focus of this project is mainly computational, this is part of a synergistic work with colleagues performing wet-lab experiments. Experiments provide data to inform simulation parameters, which in turn can guide the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, in a self-enhancing loop. In short, the main objectives of the project are to:

- Build a computational model of the regulation and interactions between CaMKII and NMDARs in a dendritic spine.
- Make biological predictions from the model which can then be tested experimentally in-vivo or in-vitro.
- Use the model to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics of early LTP and understand the role of CaMKII/NMDAR interactions.
- Develop new workflows to model biological interactions in 3D space, using software like MCell (Monte Carlo Cell) and CellBlender (Stiles et al., 1996; Kerr et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2018; Husar et al., 2022), BioNetGen (Harris et al., 2016) and BioDynaMo (Breitwieser et al., 2022).

## Why use computational modelling to study biological systems?

Experimental studies are increasingly complemented by computational models to aid in characterizing the spatiotemporal regulation of proteins of interest [REFERENCES]. Given the complexity and multiscale nature of biological systems, computational models play a crucial role in integrating experimental data, facilitating theoretical hypotheses, and exploring "what if" scenarios. Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in our understanding and guide future research directions.

Moreover, these models then serve to synthesize knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists. Additionally, computer-simulated experiments can streamline the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, making research more cost-effective, time-efficient, and environmentally friendly. This approach also promotes ethical research practices by reducing the need for animal testing, thereby minimizing animal suffering.

## The big picture: What research exists already and where does this PhD stand?

Numerous computational models of CaMKII dynamics have been developed over the past decade to look at different interactions of CaMKII and its substrates or binding partners at varying levels of detail [REFERENCES]. Many of these models center on the binding of calcium to calmodulin and the subsequent formation of the CaM-CaMKII complex [REFERENCES], but not on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex therefore making this research novel in its field. The research carried out in this PhD project follows recent studies [Pharris, Ordyan, Bartol] that have looked at CaMKII as a dodecamer to study its autophosphorylation and spatiotemporal regulation in poststynaptic dendrites using BioNetGen and MCell. Pharris look at this, Ordyan looks at this, Bartol looks at this. This is what I look at.

There is a plethora of computational models with a focus around CaMKII that use software such as NEURON [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], Smoldyn [@khan2011Sequestration], Cellular Dynamic Simulator [@byrne2011Impacts; @byrne2010Cellular], and more [REFERENCES]. While these studies provide a good foundation for understanding CaMKII dynamics, the models either focus solely on temporal dynamics without considering geometry [@maki-marttunen2020Unified], or explore both spatial and temporal dynamics but do not model CaMKII as a multimeric molecule [Pharris, CDS paper]. Some models do account for CaMKII as a multimeric dodecamer but do not focus on its interactions with NMDARs. To my knowledge, this research is novel in the field, as it incorporates all these aspects: modeling CaMKII as a dodecamer, examining spatiotemporal dynamics, and focusing specifically on the CaMKII/NMDAR complex.

Incorporating spatial, temporal, and multimeric aspects is crucial because these dimensions fundamentally shape the behavior of molecular complexes like like the CaMKII/NMDAR interaction. Spatial dynamics can reveal how the molecules interact within different cellular regions, in fact CaMKII phosphorylation levels, as well as its functions have been shown to differ depending on its subcellular localization [@davies2007ACaMKII]. Temporal dynamics are important to understand how CaMKII/NMDAR interactions evolve over time; which is a matter yet to be fully understood, such as: how long does the CaMKII/NMDAR complex last during and/or after LTP?. 

_Needs to go somewhere else not sure where:_ More recently, research is shifting from the long-standing idea that CaMKII behaves like a bistable switch to a new understanding involving a process known as "kinetic proofreading" that enhances the specificity and fidelity of CaMKII-mediated signaling. Bartol et al., 2024 propose that for LTP to occur, the autophosphorylation of CaMKII subunits does not need to reach the high, irreversible steady-state associated with the bistable switch theory. Instead, they propose that the integration of signals at the synapse must lead to a temporary surge in autophosphorylation that is sufficient to initiate one or more downstream processes, which are essentially irreversible, ultimately resulting in synaptic potentiation. This proposed mechanism aligns well with the hypothesis that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex at the PSD plays a critical role in stabilizing CaMKII in its autophosphorylated state, thereby facilitating synaptic potentiation.

## Thesis Layout: This PhD is like a house
To be completed.

As I was thinking about how to layout this thesis, an idea came to me: what if my PhD is like a house, or a hut or something like that? That would help me keep a good picture of the function of each chapter laid out here. So here are some thoughts on how this thesis is laid out; kinda like all thesis are laid out, and like all houses are built, there's common features but each thesis/house comes with the flavour of the person that lives in it.

1. BACKGROUND/PILLARS

If we think of the PhD as a house, then, the pillars or support beams are where I lay out the existing research, the theoretical background, and the context. These are solid and well-researched to support the entire structure, much like how background chapters provide the knowledge necessary to frame ones work. The background chapter in this PhD includes:

* Report style and philosophy
* Open, reproducible and ethical sience definitions
    * Ethics and Reproducibility
        * Science for the profit of whom?
        * Importance of reproducibility
        * Ethics and reproducibility go together
